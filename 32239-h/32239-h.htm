<h2>TO THE READER.</h2>

<p><i>The following pages form a part of a course of Lectures on Law and
Police, delivered in the University of William and Mary, in this
commonwealth. The Author considering the Abolition of Slavery in this
State, as an object of the first importance, not only to our moral
character and domestic peace, but even to our political salvation; and
being persuaded that the accomplishment of so momentous and desirable an
undertaking will in great measure depend upon the early adoption of some
plan for that purpose, with diffidence submits to the consideration of
his countrymen his ideas on a subject of such consequence. He flatters
himself that the plan he ventures to suggest, is liable to fewer
objections than most others that have been submitted to the
consideration of the public, as it will be attended with a gradual
change of condition in the blacks, and cannot possibly affect the
interest either of</i> creditors, <i>or any other description of persons of
the</i> present generation: <i>and posterity he makes no doubt will feel
themselves relieved from a perilous and grievous burden by the timely
adoption of a plan, whose operation may be felt by them, before they are
borne down by a weight which threatens destruction to our happiness both
public and private.</i></p>


<p class="p4"><span style="font-size: 1.8em;">&#9758;</span> The following <span class="smcap">ADDITIONAL NOTES</span> have been received from the

<hr class="small">

<p class="noindent"><i>In page 20, after the word</i> arms, <i>in line 5, read this note:</i></p>

<p>This was the case under the laws of the state; but the Act of 2. Cong.
  c. 33. for establishing an uniform militia throughout the United
  States, seems to have excluded all but free white men from bearing
  arms in the militia.</p>

<hr class="small">

<p class="noindent"><i>To the word</i> slave, <i>page 47, line 14, add the following note:</i></p>

<p>It may not be improper here to note, that the first congress of
  the United States, at their third session, Dec. 1793, passed an
  act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United
  States to any foreign place or country; the provisions of which
  seem well calculated to restrain the citizens of united America
  from embarking in so infamous a traffick.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[p. 9]</span> <h2><span class="smaller">ON THE</span><br>
STATE OF SLAVERY IN VIRGINIA.</h2>

<p>In the preceding Enquiry<a id="FNanchor1" name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1">[1]</a> into the absolute rights of the citizens of
united America, we must not be understood as if those rights were
equally and universally the privilege of all the inhabitants of the
United States, or even of all those, who may challenge this land of
freedom as their native country. Among the blessings which the Almighty
hath showered down on these states, there is a large portion of the
bitterest draught that ever flowed from the cup of affliction. Whilst
America hath been the land of promise to Europeans, and their
descendants, it hath been the vale of death to millions of the wretched
sons of Africa. The genial light of liberty, which hath here shone with
unrivalled lustre on the former, hath yielded no comfort to the latter,
but to them hath proved a pillar of darkness, whilst it hath <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[p. 10]</span> conducted
the former to the most enviable state of human existence. Whilst we were
offering up vows at the shrine of Liberty, and sacrificing hecatombs
upon her altars; whilst we swore irreconcilable hostility to her
enemies, and hurled defiance in their faces; whilst we adjured the God
of Hosts to witness our resolution to live free, or die, and imprecated
curses on their heads who refused to unite with us in establishing the
empire of freedom; we were imposing upon our fellow men, who differ in
complexion from us, a <i>slavery</i>, ten thousand times more cruel than the
utmost extremity of those grievances and oppressions, of which we
complained. Such are the inconsistencies of human nature; such the
blindness of those who pluck not the beam out of their own eyes, whilst
they can espy a moat, in the eyes of their brother; such that partial
system of morality which confines rights and injuries, to particular
complexions; such the effect of that self-love which justifies, or
condemns, not according to principle, but to the agent. Had we turned
our eyes inwardly when we supplicated the Father of Mercies to aid the
injured and oppressed; when we invoked the Author of Righteousness to
attest the purity of our motives, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[p. 11]</span> justice of our cause;<a id="FNanchor2" name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" title="Go to footnote 2">[2]</a> and
implored the God of Battles to aid our exertions in its defence, should
we not have stood more self convicted than the contrite publican! Should
we not have left our gift upon the altar, that we might be first
reconciled to our brethren whom we held in bondage? Should we not have
loosed their chains, and broken their fetters? Or if the difficulties
and dangers of such an experiment prohibited the attempt during the
convulsions of a revolution, is it not our duty to embrace the first
moment of constitutional health and vigour, to effectuate so desirable
an object, and to remove from us a stigma, with which our enemies will
never fail to upbraid us, nor our consciences to reproach us? To form a
just estimate of this obligation, to demonstrate the incompatibility of
a state of slavery with the principles of our government, and of that
revolution upon which it is founded, and to elucidate the practicability
of its total, though gradual, abolition, it will be proper to consider
the nature of slavery, its properties, attendants, and consequences in
general; its rise, progress, and present <span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[p. 12]</span> state not only in this
commonwealth, but in such of our sister states as have either perfected,
or commenced the great work of its extirpation; with the means they have
adopted to effect it, and those which the circumstances and situation of
our country may render it most expedient for us to pursue, for the
attainment of the same noble and important end.<a id="FNanchor3" name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" title="Go to footnote 3">[3]</a></p>

<p>According to Justinian; <sup>(1)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>1</sup> Lib. 1. Tit. 2.</span> the first general division of
persons, in respect to their rights, is into freemen and slaves. It is
equally the glory and the happiness of that country from which the
citizens of the United States derive their origin, that the traces of
slavery, such as at present exists in several of the United States, are
there utterly extinguished. It is not my design to enter into a minute
enquiry whether it ever had existence there, nor to compare the
situation of villeins, during the existence of pure villenage, with that
of modern domestic slaves. The records of those times, at least, such as
have reached this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>[p. 13]</span> quarter of the globe, are too few to throw a
satisfactory light on the subject. Suffice it that our ancestors
migrating hither brought not with them any prototype of that slavery
which hath been established among us. The first introduction of it into
Virginia was by the arrival of a Dutch ship from the coast of Africa
having <i>twenty</i> Negroes on board, who were sold here in the year 1620.
<sup>(2)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>2</sup> Stith 182.</span> In the year 1638 we find them in Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor4" name="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" title="Go to footnote 4">[4]</a> They
were introduced into Connecticut soon after the settlement of that
colony; that is to say, about the same period.<a id="FNanchor5" name="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" title="Go to footnote 5">[5]</a> Thus early had our
forefathers sown the seeds of an evil, which, like a leprosy, hath
descended upon their posterity with accumulated rancour, visiting the
sins of the fathers upon succeeding generations.&mdash;The climate of the
northern states less favourable to the constitution of the natives of
Africa, <sup>(3)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>3</sup> Dr. Belknap. Zephan. Swift.</span> than the southern, proved alike
unfavourable to their propagation, and to the increase of their numbers
by importations. As the southern colonies advanced in population, not
only importations increased there, but Nature herself, under a climate
more congenial to the African constitution, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>[p. 14]</span> assisted in multiplying the
blacks in those parts, no less than in diminishing their numbers in the
more rigorous climates of the north; this influence of climate moreover
contributed extremely to increase or diminish the value of the slave to
the purchasers, in the different colonies. White labourers, whose
constitutions were better adapted to the severe winters of the New
England colonies, were there found to be preferable to the Negroes, <sup>(4)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>4</sup> Dr.
Belknap. Zephan. Swift.</span> who, accustomed to the influence of an ardent
sun, became almost torpid in those countries, not less adapted to give
vigour to their laborious exercises, than unfavourable to the
multiplication of their species; in those colonies, where the winters
were not only milder, and of shorter duration, but succeeded by an
intense summer heat, as invigorating to the African, as debilitating to
the European constitution, the Negroes were not barely more capable of
performing labour than the Europeans, or their descendants, but the
multiplication of the species was at least equal; and, where they met
with humane treatment, perhaps greater than among the whites. The
purchaser therefore calculated not upon the value of the labour of his
slave only, but, if a female, he regarded her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>[p. 15]</span> as "the fruitful mother of
an hundred more:" and many of these unfortunate people have there been
in this state, whose descendants even in the compass of two or three
generations have gone near to realize the calculation.&mdash;The great
increase of slavery in the southern, in proportion to the northern
states in the union, is therefore not attributable, <i>solely</i>, to the
effect of sentiment, but to natural causes; as well as those
considerations of profit, which have, perhaps, an equal influence over
the conduct of mankind in general, in whatever country, or under
whatever climate their destiny hath placed them. What else but
considerations of this nature could have influenced the merchants of the
freest nation, at that time in the world, to embark in so nefarious a
traffic, as that of the human race, attended, as the African slave trade
has been, with the most atrocious aggravations of cruelty, perfidy, and
intrigues, the objects of which have been the perpetual fomentation of
predatory and intestine wars? What, but similar considerations, could
prevail on the government of the same country, even in these days, to
patronize a commerce so diametrically opposite to the generally received
maxims of that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[p. 16]</span> government. It is to the operation of these
considerations in the parent country, not less than to their influence
in the colonies, that the rise, increase, and continuance of slavery in
those British colonies which now constitute united America, are to be
attributed, as I shall endeavour to shew in the course of the present
enquiry. It is now time to enquire into the nature of slavery, in
general, and take a view of its consequences, and attendants in this
commonwealth, in particular.</p>

<p>Slavery, says a well informed writer <sup>(5)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>5</sup> Hargrave's case of Negroe
Somerset.</span> on the subject, has been attended with circumstances so
various in different countries, as to render it difficult to give a
general definition of it. Justinian calls it a constitution of the law
of nations, by which one man is made subject to another, contrary to
nature. <sup>(6)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>6</sup> Lib. 1. Tit. 3. Sect. 2.</span> Grotius describes it to be an
obligation to serve another for life, in consideration of diet, and
other common necessaries. <sup>(7)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>7</sup> Lib. 2. c. 5. Sect. 27</span> Dr. Rutherforth,
rejecting this definition, informs us, that perfect slavery is an
obligation to be directed by another in all one's actions. <sup>(8)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>8</sup> Lib. 1. c.
20. pa. 474.</span> Baron Montesquieu defines it to be the establishment of a
right, which gives one man such a power over another, as renders him
absolute master over his life and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>[p. 17]</span> fortune. <sup>(9)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>9</sup> Lib. 15. c. 1.</span> These
definitions appear not to embrace the subject fully, since they respect
the condition of the slave, in regard to his <i>master</i>, only, and not in
regard to the <i>state</i>, as well as the <i>master</i>. The author last
mentioned observes, that the constitution of a state may be free, and
the subject not so. The subject free, and not the constitution of the
state. <sup>(10)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>10</sup> Lib. 12. c. 1.</span> Pursuing this idea, instead of attempting a
general definition of slavery; I shall, by considering it under a
threefold aspect, endeavour to give a just idea of its nature.</p>

<p>I. When a nation is, from any external cause, deprived of the right of
being governed by its own laws, only, such a nation may be considered
as in a state of <i>political slavery</i>. Such is the state of conquered
countries, and generally, of colonies, and other dependant
governments. Such was the state of united America before the
revolution. In this case the personal rights of the subject may be so
far secured by wholesome laws, as that the individual may be esteemed
free, whilst the state is subject to a higher power: this subjection
of one nation, or people, to the will of another, constitutes the
first species of slavery, which, in order to distinguish <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>[p. 18]</span> it from the
other two, I have called political; inasmuch as it exists only in
respect to the governments, and not to the individuals of the two
countries. Of this it is not our business to speak, at present.</p>

<p>II. Civil liberty being, no other than natural liberty so far
restrained by human laws, and no farther, as is necessary and
expedient for the general advantage of the public, <sup>(11)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>11</sup> Blackstone's Com.
c. 125</span> whenever that liberty is, by the laws of the state, further
restrained than is necessary and expedient for the general advantage,
a state of <i>civil slavery</i> commences immediately: this may affect the
whole society, and every description of persons in it, and yet the
constitution of the state be perfectly free. And this happens whenever
the laws of a state respect the form, or energy of the government,
more than the happiness of the citizen; as in Venice, where the most
oppressive species of civil slavery exists, extending to every
individual in the state, from the poorest gondolier to the members of
the senate, and the doge himself.</p>

<p>This species of slavery also exists whenever there is an inequality of
rights, or privileges, between the subjects or citizens of the same
state, except such as necessarily result from the exercise of a public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>[p. 19]</span> office; for the pre-eminence of one class of men must be founded and
erected upon the depression of another; and the measure of exaltation
in the former, is that of the slavery of the latter. In all
governments, however constituted, or by what description soever
denominated, wherever the distinction of rank prevails, or is admitted
by the constitution, this species of slavery exists. It existed in
every nation, and in every government in Europe before the French
revolution. It existed in the American colonies before they became
independent states; and notwithstanding the maxims of equality which
have been adopted in their several constitutions, it exists in most,
if not all, of them, at this day, in the persons of our free Negroes
and mulattoes; whose civil incapacities are almost as numerous as the
civil rights of our free citizens. A brief enumeration of them, may
not be improper before we proceed to the third head.</p>

<p>Free Negroes and mulattoes are by our constitution excluded from the
right of suffrage,<a id="FNanchor6" name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" title="Go to footnote 6">[6]</a> and by consequence, I apprehend, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[p. 20]</span> from office
too: they were formerly incapable of serving in the militia, except as
drummers or pioneers, but now I presume they are enrolled in the lists
of those that bear arms, though formerly punishable for presuming to
appear at a muster-field. <sup>(12)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>12</sup> 1723. c. 2.</span> During the revolution war many
of them were enlisted as soldiers in the regular army. Even slaves
were not rejected from military service at that period, and such as
served faithfully during the period of their enlistment, were
emancipated by an act passed after the conclusion of the war. <sup>(13)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>13</sup> Oct.
1783. c. 3.</span> An act of justice to which they were entitled upon every
principle. All but housekeepers, and persons residing upon the
frontiers are prohibited from keeping, or carrying any gun, powder,
shot, club, or other weapon offensive or defensive: <sup>(14)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>14</sup> 1748. c. 31. Edit.
1794.</span> Resistance to a white person, in any case, was, formerly, and
now, in any case, except a wanton assault on the Negroe or mulattoe,
is punishable by whipping. <sup>(15)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>15</sup> Ib. c. 103.</span> No Negroe or mulattoe can be
a witness <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>[p. 21]</span> in any prosecution, or civil suit in which a white person is
a party. <sup>(16)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>16</sup> 1794. c. 141.</span> Free Negroes together with slaves were
formerly denied the benefit of clergy in cases where it was allowed to
white persons; but they are now upon an equal footing as to the
allowance of clergy, though not as to the consequence of that
allowance, inasmuch as the court may superadd other corporal
punishments to the burning in the hand usually inflicted upon white
persons, in the like cases. <sup>(17)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>17</sup> 1794. c. 103.</span> Emancipated Negroes may be
sold to pay the debts of their former master contracted before their
emancipation; and they may be hired out to satisfy their taxes where
no sufficient distress can be had. Their children are to be bound out
apprentices by the overseers of the poor. Free Negroes have all the
advantages in capital cases, which white men are entitled to, except a
trial by a jury of their own complexion: and a slave suing for his
freedom shall have the same privilege. Free Negroes residing, or
employed to labour in any town must be registered; the same thing is
required of such as go at large in any county. The penalty in both
cases is a fine upon the person employing, or harbouring them, and
imprisonment of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[p. 22]</span> Negroe. <sup>(18)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>18</sup> 1794. c. 163.</span> The migration of free
Negroes or mulattoes to this state is also prohibited; and those who
do migrate hither may be sent back to the place from whence they came.
<sup>(19)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>19</sup> 1794. c. 164.</span> Any person, not being a Negroe, having one-fourth or
more Negroe blood in him is deemed a mulattoe. The law makes no other
distinction between Negroes and mulattoes, whether slaves or freemen.
These incapacities and disabilities are evidently the fruit of the
third species of slavery, of which it remains to speak; or, rather,
they are scions from the same common stock: which is,</p>

<p>III. That condition in which one man is subject to be directed by
another in all his actions; and this constitutes a state of <i>domestic
slavery</i>; to which state all the incapacities and disabilities of
civil slavery are incident, with the weight of other numerous
calamities superadded thereto. And here it may be proper to make a
short enquiry into the origin and foundation of domestic slavery in
other countries, previous to its fatal introduction into this.</p>

<p>Slaves, says Justinian, are either born such or become so. <sup>(20)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>20</sup> Inst. lib. 1.
tit. 1.</span> They are born slaves when they are children of bond women; and
they become slaves, either <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[p. 23]</span> by the law of nations, that is, by captivity;
for it is the practice of our generals to sell their captives, being
accustomed to preserve, and not to destroy them: or by the civil law,
which happens when a free person, above the age of twenty, suffers
himself to be sold for the sake of sharing the price given for him. The
author of the Commentaries on the Laws of England thus combats the
reasonableness of all these grounds: <sup>(21)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>21</sup> 1. b. c. 423.</span> "The conqueror,"
says he, "according to the civilians, had a right to the life of his
captives; and having spared that, has a right to deal with him as he
pleases. But it is an untrue position, when taken generally, that by the
law of nature or nations, a man may kill his enemy: he has a right to
kill him only in particular cases; in cases of absolute necessity for
self-defence; and it is plain that this absolute necessity did not
subsist, since the victor did not actually kill him, but made him
prisoner. War itself is justifiable only on principles of
self-preservation; and therefore it gives no other right over prisoners
but merely to disable them from doing harm to us, by confining their
persons: much less can it give a right to kill, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>[p. 24]</span> torture, abuse, plunder,
or even to enslave, an enemy, when the war is over. Since therefore the
right of <i>making</i> slaves by captivity, depends on a supposed right of
slaughter, that foundation failing, the consequence drawn from it must
fail likewise. But, secondly, it is said slavery may begin <i>jure
civili</i>; when one man sells himself to another. This, if only meant of
contracts to serve, or work for, another, is very just: but when applied
to strict slavery, in the sense of the laws of old Rome or modern
Barbary, is also impossible. Every sale implies a price, a <i>quid pro
quo</i>, an equivalent given to the seller, in lieu of what he transfers to
the buyer; but what equivalent can be given for life and liberty, both
of which, in absolute slavery, are held to be in the master's disposal?
His property, also, the very price he seems to receive, devolves, <i>ipso
facto</i>, to his master, the instant he becomes a slave. In this case,
therefore, the buyer gives nothing, and the seller receives nothing: of
what validity then can a sale be, which destroys the very principles
upon which all sales are founded? Lastly we are told, that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[p. 25]</span> besides these
two ways by which slaves are acquired, they may also be hereditary;
"<i>servi nascuntur</i>;" the children of acquired slaves are, "jure naturæ,"
by a negative kind of birthright, slaves also.&mdash;But <i>this, being built
on the two former rights</i>, must <i>fall</i> together with them. If neither
captivity, nor the sale of one's self, can by the law of nature and
reason reduce the parent to slavery, <i>much less</i> can they reduce the
offspring." Thus by the most clear, manly, and convincing reasoning does
this excellent author refute every claim upon which the practice of
slavery is founded, or by which it has been supposed to be justified, at
least, in modern times.<a id="FNanchor7" name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7">[7]</a> But were we even to admit, that a captive
taken in a <i>just war</i>, might by his conqueror be reduced to a state of
slavery, this could not justify the claim of Europeans to reduce the
natives of Africa to that state: it is a melancholy, though well-known
fact, that in order to furnish supplies of these unhappy people for the
purposes of the slave trade, the Europeans have constantly, by the most
insidious (I had almost said infernal) arts, fomented <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>[p. 26]</span> a kind of
perpetual warfare among the ignorant and miserable people of Africa; and
instances have not been wanting, where, by the most shameful breach of
faith, they have trepanned end made slaves of the <i>sellers</i> as well as
the <i>sold</i>.<a id="FNanchor8" name="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" title="Go to footnote 8">[8]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>[p. 27]</span> That such horrid practices have been sanctioned by a

article in the foundation of their government, should in defiance of so
sacred a truth, recognized by themselves in so solemn a manner, and on
so important an occasion, tolerate a practice incompatible therewith, is
such an evidence of the weakness and inconsistency of human nature, as
every man who hath a spark of patriotic fire in his bosom must wish to
see removed from his own country. If ever there was a cause, if ever an
occasion, in which all hearts should be united, every nerve strained,
and every power exerted, surely the restoration of human nature to its
inalienable right is such: Whatever obstacles, therefore, may hitherto
have retarded the attempt, he that can appreciate the honour and

surmount them.</p>

<p>But how loudly soever reason, justice, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>[p. 31]</span> and (may I not add) religion,<a id="FNanchor9" name="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" title="Go to footnote 9">[9]</a>
condemn the practice of slavery, it is acknowledged to have been very
ancient, and almost universal. The Greeks, the Romans, and the ancient
Germans also practiced it, as well as the more ancient Jews and
Egyptians. By the Germans it was transmitted to the various kingdoms
which arose in Europe out of the ruins of the Roman empire. In England
it subsisted for some ages under the name of <i>villeinage</i>.<a id="FNanchor10" name="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" title="Go to footnote 10">[10]</a> In Asia
it seems to have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[p. 32]</span> been general, and in Africa universal, and so remains
to this day: In Europe it hath long since declined; its first declension
there, is said to have been in Spain, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>[p. 33]</span> as early as the eighth century;
and it is alleged to have been general about the middle of the
fourteenth, and was near expiring in the sixteenth, when the discovery
of the American continent, and the eastern and western coasts of Africa
gave rise to the introduction of a new species of slavery. It took its
origin from the Portuguese, who, in order to supply the Spaniards with
persons able to sustain the fatigue of cultivating their new possessions
in America, particularly the islands, opened a trade between Africa and
America for the sale of Negroes, about the year 1508. The expedient of
having slaves for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>[p. 34]</span> labour was not long peculiar to the Spaniards, being
afterwards adopted by other European colonies: <sup>(23)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>23</sup> Hargrave, ib.</span> and
though some attempts have been made to stop its progress in most of the
United States, and several of them have the fairest prospects of success
in attempting the extirpation of it, yet is others, it hath taken such
deep root, as to require the most strenuous exertions to eradicate it.</p>

<p>The first introduction of Negroes into Virginia happened, as we have
already mentioned, in the year 1620; from that period to the year 1662
there is no compilation of our laws, in print, now to be met with. In
the revision made in that year, we find an act declaring that no
Englishman, trader, or other, who shall bring in any Indians as servants
and assign them over to any other, shall sell them for <i>slaves</i>, nor for
any other time than English of like age should serve by act of assembly.
<sup>(24)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>24</sup> 1662. c. 136.</span> The succeeding session all children born in this
country were declared to be bond, or free, according to the condition of
the mother. <sup>(25)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>25</sup> 1662. Sess. d. c. 12.</span> In 1667 it was declared, "That the
conferring of baptism doth not alter the condition of the person
baptized, as to his bondage or freedom." <sup>(26)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>26</sup> 1667. c. 2.</span> This was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[p. 35]</span> done,
"that divers masters freed from this doubt may more carefully endeavour
the propagating of Christianity, by permitting their slaves to be
baptized." It would have been happy for this unfortunate race of men if
the same tender regard for their bodies, had always manifested itself in
our laws, as is shewn for their souls in this act. But this was not the
case; for two years after, we meet with an act, declaring, "That if any
slave resist his master, or others, by his master's orders correcting
him, and by the extremity of the correction should chance to die, such
death should not be accounted felony: but the master or other person
appointed by his master to punish him, be acquit from molestation:
<i>since it could not be presumed that prepensive malice</i>, which alone
makes <i>murder felony</i>, should induce any man to destroy his own
estate."<a id="FNanchor11" name="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" title="Go to footnote 11">[11]</a> This cruel and tyrannical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[p. 36]</span> act was, at three different
periods <sup>(27)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>27</sup> 1705. c. 49. 1723. c. 4. 1748. c. 31.</span> re-enacted, with very
little alteration; and was not finally repealed till the year 1788
<sup>(28)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>28</sup> 1788. c. 23.</span>&mdash;above a century after it had first disgraced our code.
In 1668 we meet with the first traces of emancipation, in an act which
subjects Negroe women set free to the tax on titheables. <sup>(29)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>29</sup> 1668. c. 7.</span>
Two years after, <sup>(30)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>30</sup> 1670. c. 5.</span> an act passed prohibiting <i>Indians</i> or
Negroes, manumitted, or otherwise set free, though baptized, from
purchasing Christian servants. <sup>(31)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>31</sup> 1670. c. 12.</span> From this act it is
evident that <i>Indians</i> had <i>before</i> that time been made slaves, as well
as Negroes, though we have no traces of the original act by which they
were reduced to that condition. An act of the same session recites that
disputes had arisen whether Indians taken in war by any other nation,
and by that nation sold to the English, are servants for <i>life</i>, or for
a term of years; and declaring that all <i>servants</i>, not being
Christians, imported into this country by <i>shipping</i>, shall be <i>slaves</i>
for their life-time; but that what shall come by land, shall serve, if
boys and girls, until thirty years of age; if men and women twelve
years, and no longer. On a rupture with the Indians in the year 1679 it
was, for the <i>better encouragement <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>[p. 37]</span> of soldiers</i>, declared that what
<i>Indian</i> prisoners should be <i>taken in war</i> should be free purchase to
the soldier <i>taking</i> them. <sup>(32)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>32</sup> 1679. c. 1.</span> Three years after it was
declared that all <i>servants</i> brought into this country by sea or land,
not being Christians, whether Negroes, Moors, mulattoes or Indians,
except Turks and Moors in amity with Great Britain, and all Indians
which should thereafter be sold by neighbouring Indians, or any others
trafficking with us, as slaves, should be slaves to all intents and
purposes. <sup>(33)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>33</sup> 1682. c. 1.</span> This act was re-enacted in the year 1705, and
afterwards in 1753, <sup>(34)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>34</sup> 1705 c. 49. 1753. c. 2.</span> nearly in the same terms.
In 1705 an act was made, authorising a free and open trade for all
persons, at all times, and at all places, with all Indians whatsoever.
<sup>(35)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>35</sup> 1705 c. 52.</span> On the authority of this act, the general court in April
term 1787 decided that no Indians brought into Virginia since the
passing thereof, nor their descendants, can be slaves in this
commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor12" name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" title="Go to footnote 12">[12]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>[p. 38]</span> In October 1778 the general assembly passed the first
act which occurs in our code for prohibiting the importation of slaves;
<sup>(36)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>36</sup> 1778. c. 1.</span> thereby declaring that no slave should thereafter be
brought into this commonwealth by land, or by water; and that every
slave imported contrary thereto, should upon such importation be free:
with an exception as to such as might belong to persons migrating from
the other states, or be claimed by descent, devise, or marriage, or be
at that time the actual property of any citizen of this commonwealth,
residing in any other of the United States, or belonging to travellers
making a transient stay, and carrying their slaves away with them.&mdash;In
1705 this act unfortunately underwent some alteration, by declaring that
slaves thereafter brought into this commonwealth, and kept therein one
whole <i>year together</i>, or so long at different times as shall <i>amount to
a year</i>, shall be free. By <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>[p. 39]</span> this means the difficulty of proving the
right to freedom will be not a little augmented: for the fact of the
first importation, where the right to freedom immediately ensued, might
have been always proved without difficulty; but where a slave is subject
to removal from place to place, and his right to freedom is postponed
for so long a time as a whole year, or perhaps several years, the
provisions in favour of liberty may be too easily evaded. The same act
declares that no persons shall thenceforth be slaves in this
commonwealth, except such as were so on the first day of that session
(Oct. 17th, 1785), and the descendants of the females of them. This act
was re-enacted in the revisal made in 1792. <sup>(37)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>37</sup> See acts of 1794, c. 103.</span>
In 1793 an additional act passed, authorising and requiring any justice
of the peace having notice of the importation of any slaves, directly or
indirectly, from any part of Africa or the West Indies, to cause such
slave to be immediately apprehended and transported out of the
commonwealth. <sup>(38)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>38</sup> Edit. of 1794. c. 164.</span> Such is the rise, progress, and
present foundation of slavery in Virginia, so far as I have been able to
trace it. The present number of slaves in Virginia, is immense, as
appears by the census taken in 1791, amounting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>[p. 40]</span> to no less than 292,427
souls: nearly two-fifths of the whole population of the
commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor13" name="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" title="Go to footnote 13">[13]</a> We may console ourselves with the hope that this
proportion <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>[p. 41]</span> will not increase, the further importation of slaves being
prohibited, whilst the free migrations of white people hither is
encouraged. But this hope affords no other relief from the evil of
slavery, than a diminution of those apprehensions which are naturally
excited by the detention of so large a number of oppressed individuals
among us, and the possibility that they may one day be roused to an
attempt to shake off their chains.</p>

<p>Whatever inclination the first inhabitants of Virginia might have to
encourage slavery, a disposition to check its progress, and increase,
manifested itself in the legislature even before the close of the last
century. So long ago as the year 1669 we find the title of an act, <sup>(39)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>39</sup> Edit.
of 1733. c. 12.</span> laying an imposition upon <i>servants</i>, and <i>slaves</i>,
imported into this country; which was either continued, revised, or
increased, by a variety of temporary acts, passed between that period
and the revolution in 1776.<a id="FNanchor14" name="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote14" title="Go to footnote 14">[14]</a>&mdash;One of these acts passed in 1723, by a
marginal note appears to have been repealed by proclamation, Oct. 24,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>[p. 42]</span> 1724. In 1732 a duty of five per cent. was laid on slaves imported, to
be paid by the buyers; a measure calculated to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>[p. 43]</span> render it as little
obnoxious as possible to the <i>English</i> merchants trading to Africa, and
not improbably suggested by them, to the privy council in England. The
preamble to this act is in these remarkable words, "We your majesty's
most dutiful and loyal subjects, &amp;c. taking into our serious
consideration the exigencies of your government here, and that the duty
laid upon liquors will not be sufficient to defray the necessary
expences thereof, do humbly represent to your majesty, that <i>no other</i>
duty can be laid upon our import or export, without oppressing your
subjects, than a duty upon <i>slaves imported</i>, to be paid by the buyers,
<i>agreeable to your majesty's instructions</i> to your lieutenant governor."
This act was only for the short period of four years, but seems to have
been continued from time to time till the year 1751, when the duty
expired, but was revived the next year. In the year 1740 an additional
duty of five per cent. was imposed for four years, for the purpose of an
expedition against the Spaniards, &amp;c. to be likewise paid by the buyers:
and in 1742 the whole duty was continued till July 1, 1747.&mdash;The act of
1752, by which these duties were revived <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>[p. 44]</span> and continued (as well as
several former acts), takes notice that the duty had been found <i>no ways
burdensome to the traders</i> in slaves. In 1754 an additional duty of five
per cent. was imposed for the term of three years, by an act for
encouraging and protecting the settlers on the Missisippi: this duty,
like all the former, was to be paid by the buyers. In 1759 a duty of 20
per cent. was imposed upon all slaves imported into Virginia from
Maryland, North Carolina, or other places in America, to continue for
seven years. In 1769 the same duty was further continued. In the same
session the duty of five per cent. was continued for three years, and an
additional duty of ten per cent. to be likewise paid by the buyers, was
imposed for seven years; and a further duty of five per cent. was, by a
separate act of the same session, imposed for the better support of the
contingent charges of government, to be paid by the buyers. In 1772 all
these duties were further continued for the term of five years from the
expiration of the acts then in force: the assembly at the same time
petitioned the throne,<a id="FNanchor15" name="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote15" title="Go to footnote 15">[15]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>[p. 45]</span> <i>to remove all those restraints which
inhibited</i> his majesty's governors assenting to such <i>laws</i> as <i>might
check so very pernicious a commerce</i>, as that of slavery.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>[p. 46]</span> <p>In the course of this enquiry it is easy to trace the desire of the
legislature to put a stop to the further importation of slaves; and had
not this desire been uniformly opposed on the part of the crown, it is
highly probable that event would have taken effect at a much earlier
period than it did. A duty of five per cent. to be paid by the buyers,
at first, with difficulty obtained the royal assent. Requisitions from
the crown for aids, on particular occasions, afforded a pretext from
time to time for increasing the duty from five, to ten, and finally to
twenty per cent. with which the <i>buyer</i> was uniformly made chargeable.
The wishes of the people of this colony, were not sufficient to
counterbalance the interest of the English merchants, trading to Africa,
and it is probable, that however disposed to put a stop to so infamous a
traffic by law, we should never have been able to effect it, so long as
we might have continued dependant on the British government: an object
sufficient of itself to justify a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>[p. 47]</span> revolution. That the legislature of
Virginia were <i>sincerely</i> disposed to put a stop to it, cannot be
doubted; for even during the tumult and confusion of the revolution, we
have seen that they availed themselves of the earliest opportunity, to
crush for ever so pernicious and infamous a commerce, by an act passed
in October 1778, the penalties of which, though apparently lessened by
the act of 1792, are still equal to the value of the slave; being two
hundred dollars upon the importer, and one hundred dollars upon every
person buying or selling an imported slave.</p>

<p>A system uniformly persisted in for nearly a whole century, and finally
carried into effect, so soon as the legislature was unrestrained by "the
inhuman exercise of the royal negative," evinces the sincerity of that
disposition which the legislature had shewn during so long a period, to
put a check to the growing evil. From the time that the duty was raised
above five per cent. it is probable that the importation of slaves into
this colony decreased. The demand for them in the more southern colonies
probably contributed also to lessen the numbers imported into this: for
some years immediately preceding the revolution, the importation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>[p. 48]</span> slaves into Virginia might almost be considered as at an end; and
probably would have been entirely so, if the ingenuity of the merchant
had not found out the means of evading the heavy duty, by pretended
sales, at which the slaves were bought in by some friend, at a quarter
of their real value.</p>

<p>Tedious and unentertaining as this detail may appear to all others, a
citizen of Virginia will feel some satisfaction at reading so clear a
vindication of his country, from the opprobrium, but too lavishly
bestowed upon her of fostering slavery in her bosom, whilst she boasts a
sacred regard to the liberty of her citizens, and of mankind in general.
The acrimony of such censures must abate, at least in the breasts of the
candid, upon an impartial review of the subject here brought before
them; and if in addition to what we have already advanced, they consider
the difficulties attendant on any plan for the abolition of slavery, in
a country where so large a proportion of the inhabitants are slaves; and
where a still larger proportion of the cultivators of the earth are of
that description of men, they will probably feel emotions of sympathy
and compassion, both for the slave and for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>[p. 49]</span> his master, succeed to those
hasty prejudices, which even the best dispositions are not exempt from
contracting, upon subjects where there is a deficiency of information.</p>

<p>We are next to consider the condition of slaves in Virginia, or
the legal consequences attendant on a state of slavery in this
commonwealth; and here it is not my intention to notice those
laws, which consider slaves, merely as <i>property</i>, and have from
time to time been enacted to regulate the disposition of them,
<i>as such</i>; for these will be more properly considered elsewhere:
my intention at present is therefore to take a view of such laws,
only, as regard slaves, as a distinct class of <i>persons</i>, whose
rights, if indeed they possess any, are reduced to a much
narrower compass, than those, of which we have been speaking
before.</p>

<p>Civil rights, we may remember, are reducible to three primary heads; the
right of personal security; the right of personal liberty; and the right
of private property. In a state of slavery the two last are wholly
abolished, the person of the slave being at the absolute disposal of his
master; and property, what he is incapable, in that state, either of
acquiring, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>[p. 50]</span> or holding, to his own use. Hence it will appear how
perfectly irreconcilable a state of slavery is to the principles of a
democracy, which form the <i>basis</i> and <i>foundation</i> of our government.
For our bill of rights declares, "that all men are by nature <i>equally
free</i> and independent, and have certain rights of which they cannot
deprive or divest their posterity&mdash;namely, the enjoyment of life and
<i>liberty</i>, with the means of <i>acquiring</i> and <i>possessing property</i>."
This is indeed no more than a recognition of the first principles of the
law of nature, which teaches us this equality, and enjoins every man,
whatever advantages he may possess over another, as to the various
qualities or endowments of body or mind, to practice the precepts of the
law of nature to those who are in these respects his <i>inferiors</i>, no
less than it enjoins his <i>inferiors</i> to practise them towards <i>him</i>.
Since he has no more right to insult <i>them</i>, than they have to injure
him. Nor does the <i>bare unkindness of nature</i> or of fortune condemn a
man to a <i>worse</i> condition than others, as to the enjoyment of common
privileges. <sup>(40)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>40</sup> Spavan's Puff. vol. 1. c. 17.</span> It would be hard to
reconcile reducing the Negroes to a state of slavery to these
principles, unless we first <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>[p. 51]</span> degrade them below the rank of human beings,
not only politically, but also physically and morally.&mdash;The Roman
lawyers look upon those only properly as <i>persons</i>, who are <i>free</i>,
putting <i>slaves</i> into the rank of <i>goods</i> and <i>chattels</i>; and the policy
of our legislature, as well as the practice of slave-holders in America
in general, seems conformable to that idea: but surely it is time we
should admit the evidence of moral truth, and learn to regard them as
our fellow men, and equals, except in those particulars where accident,
or perhaps nature, may have give us some advantage; a recompence for
which they perhaps enjoy in other respects.</p>

<p>Slavery, says Hargrave, always imports an obligation of perpetual
service, which only the consent of the master can dissolve: it also
generally gives to the master an arbitrary power of administring every
sort of correction, however inhuman, not immediately affecting life or
limb, and even these in some countries, as formerly in Rome, and at this
day among the Asiatics and Africans, are left exposed to the arbitrary
will of a master, or protected only by fines or other slight
punishments. The property of the slave <span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>[p. 52]</span> also is absolutely the property
of his master, the slave himself being the subject of property, and as
such saleable, or transmissible at the will of his master.&mdash;A slavery,
so malignant as that described, does not leave to its wretched victims
the least vestige of any civil right, and even divests them of all their
natural rights. It does not, however, appear, that the rigours of
slavery in this country were ever as great, as those above described:
yet it must be confessed, that, at times, they have fallen very little
short of them.</p>

<p>The first severe law respecting slaves, now to be met with in our code,
is that of 1669, already mentioned, which declared that the death of a
slave <i>resisting</i> his master, or other person correcting him by his
order, <i>happening by extremity of the correction</i>, should not be
accounted felony. The alterations which this law underwent in three
successive acts, <sup>(41)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>41</sup> 1705. c. 49. 1723, c. 4. 1748. c. 31.</span> were by no
means calculated effectually to mitigate its severity; it seems rather
to have been augmented by the act of 1723, which declared that a person
indicted for the murder of a slave, and found guilty of <i>manslaughter</i>,
should not incur any punishment for the same.<a id="FNanchor16" name="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" title="Go to footnote 16">[16]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>[p. 53]</span> <p>All these acts were at length repealed in 1788. <sup>(42)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>42</sup> 1788. 2. 23.</span> So that
homicide of a slave stands now upon the same footing, as in the case
of any other person. In 1672 it was declared lawful for any person
pursuing any runaway Negroe, mulattoe, Indian slave, or <i>servant for
life</i>, by virtue of an <i>hue and cry</i>, to kill them in case of
resistance, without being questioned for the same. <sup>(43)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>43</sup> 1672. c. 8.</span> A few
years afterwards this act was extended to persons <i>employed to
apprehend</i> runaways. <sup>(44)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>44</sup> 1680. c. 10.</span> In 1705, these acts underwent some
small alteration; two justices being authorised by proclamation to
<i>outlaw</i> runaways, who might thereafter be <i>killed</i> and destroyed by
any person whatsoever, by <i>such ways and means</i> as he may think fit,
without accusation or impeachment of any crime for so doing: <sup>(45)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>45</sup> 1705. c.
49.</span> And if any such slave were apprehended, he might be punished at
the discretion of the county court, either by <i>dismembering</i>, or in
any other manner not <i>touching life</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>[p. 54]</span> The inhuman rigour of this act
was afterwards <sup>(46)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>46</sup> 1723. c. 4. 1748. c. 31.</span> extended to the venial
offence of going abroad by night, if the slave was <i>notoriously</i>
guilty of it.&mdash;Such are the cruelties to which a state of slavery
gives birth; such the horrors to which the human mind is capable of
being reconciled, by its adoption. The dawn of humanity at length
appeared in the year 1769, when the power of dismembering, even under
the authority of a county court, was restricted to the single offence
of <i>attempting</i> to ravish a white woman, <sup>(47)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>47</sup> 1769. c. 19.</span> in which case
perhaps the punishment is perhaps not more than commensurate to the
crime. In 1772 some restraints were laid upon the practice of
outlawing slaves, requiring that it should appear to the
<i>satisfaction</i> of the justices that the slaves were outlying, and
<i>doing mischief</i>. <sup>(48)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>48</sup> 1772. c. 9.</span> These loose expressions of the act,
left too much in the discretion of men, not much addicted to weighing
their import.&mdash;In 1792, every thing relative to the outlawry of slaves
was <i>expunged</i> from our code, <sup>(49)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>49</sup> Edit. 1794. c. 103.</span> and I trust will
never again find a place in it. By the act of 1680, a Negroe,
mulattoe, or Indian, bond or <i>free</i>, presuming to lift his hand in
opposition to any Christian, should receive thirty lashes on his bare
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>[p. 55]</span> back for every offence. <sup>(50)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>50</sup> 1680. c. 10. 1705. c.</span> The same act
prohibited slaves from carrying any club, staff, gun, sword, or other
weapon, offensive or defensive. This was afterwards extended to all
Negroes, mulattoes and Indians whatsoever, with a few exceptions in

as were enlisted in the militia. <sup>(51)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>51</sup> 1723. c. 4.</span> Slaves, by these and

their masters, and if they do, may be whipped: any person suffering a
slave to remain on his plantation for four hours together, or dealing
with him without leave in writing from his master, is subject to a
fine. A runaway slave may be apprehended and committed to jail, and if
not claimed within three months (being first advertised) he shall be
hired out, having an iron collar first put about his neck: and if not
claimed within a year shall be sold. <sup>(53)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>53</sup> 1753. c. 2.</span> These provisions
were in general re-enacted in 1792, <sup>(54)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>54</sup> Edit. of 1794. c. 103. 131.</span> but
the punishment to be inflicted on a Negroe or mulattoe, for lifting
his hand against a white person, is restricted to those cases, where
the former is not wantonly assaulted. In this act the word Indian
appears to have been designedly omitted: the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>[p. 56]</span> small number of these
people, or their descendants remaining among us, concurring with a
more liberal way of thinking, probably gave occasion to this
circumstance. The act of 1748, c. 31, made it felony without benefit
of clergy for a slave to prepare, exhibit, or administer any medicine
whatever, without the order or consent of the master; but <i>allowed
clergy</i> if it appeared that the medicine was not administered with an
<i>ill intent</i>; the act of 1792, with more justice, directs that in such
case he shall be acquitted. <sup>(55)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>55</sup> Edit. 1794. c. 103.</span> To consult, advise,
or conspire, to rebel, or to plot, or conspire the death of any person
whatsoever, is still felony without benefit of clergy in a slave.

slaves or not, are incapable of being witnesses, but against, or
between Negroes and mulattoes; they are not permitted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>[p. 57]</span> to intermarry
with any white person; yet no punishment is annexed to the offence in
the slave; nor is the marriage void; but the white person contracting
the marriage, and the clergyman by whom it is celebrated are liable to
fine and imprisonment; and this is probably the only instance in which
our laws will be found more favourable to a Negroe than a white
person. These provisions though introduced into our code at different
periods, were all re-enacted in 1792. <sup>(59)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>59</sup> Edit. of 1794. c. 103.</span></p>

<p>From this melancholy review it will appear that not only the right of
property, and the right of personal liberty, but even the right of
personal security, has been, at times, either wholly annihilated, or
reduced to a shadow: and even in these days, the protection of the
latter seems to be confined to very few cases. Many actions, indifferent
in themselves, being permitted by the law of nature to all mankind, and
by the laws of society to all free persons, are either rendered highly
criminal in a slave, or subject him to some kind of punishment or
restraint. Nor is it in this respect only, that his condition is
rendered thus deplorable by law. The measure of punishment for the same
offence, is often, and the manner of trial <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>[p. 58]</span> and conviction is always,
different in the case of a slave, and a free-man. If the latter be
accused of any crime, he is entitled to an examination before the court
of the county where the offence is alleged to have been committed; whose
decision, if in his favour, is held to be a legal and final acquittal,
but it is not final if against him; for after this, both a grand jury,
and a petit jury of the county, must successively pronounce him guilty;
the former by the concurrent voices of twelve at least, of their body,
and the latter, by their unanimous verdict upon oath. He may take
exception to the proceedings against him, by a motion in arrest of
judgment; and in this case, or if there be a special verdict, the same
unanimity between his judges, as between his jurors, is necessary to his
condemnation. Lastly, through the punishment which the law pronounces
for his offence amount to death itself, he shall in many cases have the
benefit of clergy, unless he has before received it. But in the case of
a slave, the mode was formerly, and still remains essentially different.
How early this distinction was adopted I have not been able to discover.
The title of an act occurs, which passed in the year 1705 <sup>(60)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>60</sup> 1705. c. 11.</span>
for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>[p. 59]</span> <i>speedy</i> and <i>easy</i> prosecution of slaves committing capital
crimes. In 1723 <sup>(61)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>61</sup> 1723. c. 4.</span> the governor was authorized, whenever any
slave was committed for any capital offence, to issue a special
commission of oyer and terminer, to <i>such persons as he should think
fit</i>, the number being left to his discretion, who should thereupon
proceed to the trial of such slave, taking for evidence the confession
of the defendant, the oath of one or more credible witnesses, or such
testimony of Negroes, mulattoes, or Indians, bond or free, with pregnant
circumstances, as to them should seem convincing, without the solemnity
of a jury. No exception, formerly, could be taken to the proceedings, on
the trial of a slave, <sup>(62)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>62</sup> 1748. c. 31.</span> but that proviso is omitted in the
act of 1792, and the justices moreover seem bound to allow him counsel
for his defence, whose fee shall be paid by his master <sup>(63)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>63</sup> Edit. 1794. c.
103.</span> In case of conviction, execution of the sentence was probably very
speedily performed, since the act of 1748, provides that, thereafter, it
should not be performed in less than ten days, except in case of
insurrection or rebellion; and further, that if the court be divided in
opinion the accused should be acquitted. In 1764, an act passed,
authorizing general, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>[p. 60]</span> instead of special, commissioners of oyer and
terminer, <sup>(64)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>64</sup> 1764. c. 9.</span> constituting all the justices of any county,
judges for the trial of slaves, committing capital offences, within
their respective counties; any four of whom, one being of the quorum,
should constitute a court for that purpose. In 1772 one step further was
made in favour of humanity, by an act declaring that no slave should
thereafter be condemned to die unless four of the court should concur in
opinion of his guilt. <sup>(65)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>65</sup> 1772. c. 9.</span> The act of 1786, c. 58, confirmed by
that of 1792, constitutes the justices of every county and corporation
justices of oyer and terminer for the trial of slaves; <sup>(66)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>66</sup> Edit. 1794. c.
103.</span> requires <i>five</i> justices, at least, to constitute a court, and
<i>unanimity</i> in the court for his condemnation; allows him counsel for
his defence, to be paid by his owner, and, I apprehend, admits him to
object to the proceedings against him; and finally enlarges the time of
execution to <i>thirty</i> days, instead of ten (except in cases of
conspiracy, insurrection, or rebellion), and extends the benefit of
clergy to him in all cases, where any other person should have the
benefit thereof, except in the cases before mentioned.</p>

<p>To an attentive observer these gradual, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>[p. 61]</span> and almost imperceptible
amendments in our jurisprudence respecting slaves, will be found, upon
the whole, of infinite importance to that unhappy race. The mode of
trial in criminal cases, especially, is rendered infinitely more
beneficial to them, than formerly, though perhaps still liable to
exception for want of the aid of a jury: the solemnity of an oath
administered the moment the trial commences, may be considered as
operating more forcibly on the mind, than a general oath of office,
taken, perhaps, twenty years before. Unanimity may also be more readily
expected to take place among <i>five</i> men, than among <i>twelve</i>. These
objections to the want of a jury are not without weight: on the other
hand it may be observed, that if the number of triers be not equal to a
full jury, they may yet be considered as more select; a circumstance of
infinitely greater importance to the slave. The unanimity requisite in
the court in order to conviction, is a more happy acquisition to the
accused, than may at first appear; the opinions of the court must be
delivered openly, immediately, and seriatim, beginning with the youngest
judge. A single voice in favour of the accused, is an acquittal; for
unanimity is not necessary, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>[p. 62]</span> as with a jury, to acquit, as well as to
condemn: there is less danger in this mode of trial, where the suffrages
are to be openly delivered, that a few will be brought over to the
opinion of the majority, as may too often happen among jurors, whose
deliberations are in <i>private</i>, and whose impatience of confinement may
go further than real conviction, to produce the requisite unanimity.
That this happens not unfrequently in civil cases, there is too much
reason to believe; that it may also happen in criminal cases, especially
where the party accused is not one of their equals, might, not
unreasonably, be apprehended. In New-York, before the revolution, a
slave accused of a capital crime, should have been tried by a jury if
his master required it. This is, perhaps, still the law of that state.
Such a provision might not be amiss in this; but considering the
ordinary run of juries in the county-courts, I should presume the
privilege would be rarely insisted upon.</p>

<p>Slaves, we have seen, are now entitled to the benefit of clergy in all
cases where it is allowed to any other offenders, except in cases of
consulting, advising, or conspiring to rebel, or make insurrection; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>[p. 63]</span> or
plotting or conspiring to murder any person; or preparing, exhibiting,
or administring medicine with an <i>ill</i> intent. The same lenity was not
extended to them formerly. The act of 1748, c. 31, denied it to a slave
in case of manslaughter; or the felonious breaking and entering <i>any</i>
house, in the night time: or breaking and entering <i>any</i> house in the
day time, and taking therefrom goods to the value of twenty shillings.
The act of 1764, c. 9, extended the benefit of clergy, to a slave
convicted of the manslaughter of a slave; and the act of 1772, c. 9,
extended it further, to a slave convicted of housebreaking in the night
time, unless such breaking be burglary; in the latter case, other
offenders would be equally deprived of it. But wherever the benefit of
clergy is allowed to a slave, the court, besides burning him in the hand
(the usual punishment inflicted on free persons) may inflict such
further corporal punishment as they may think fit; <sup>(67)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>67</sup> 1794. c. 103.</span> this
also seems to be the law in the case of free Negroes and mulattoes. By
the act of 1723, c. 4, it was enacted, that when <i>any Negroe</i> or
<i>mulattoe</i> shall be found, upon due proof made, or <i>pregnant
circumstances</i>, to have given false testimony, every such offender
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>[p. 64]</span> shall, <i>without further trial</i>, have his ears successively nailed to the
pillory for the space of an hour, and then cut off, and moreover receive
thirty-nine lashes on his bare back, or such other punishment as the
court shall think proper, not extending to life or limb. This act, with
the exception of the words <i>pregnant circumstances</i>, was re-enacted in
1792. The punishment of perjury, in a <i>white</i> person, is only a fine and
imprisonment. A slave convicted of hog-stealing, shall, for the first
offence, receive thirty-nine lashes: any other person twenty-five: but
the latter is also subject to a fine of thirty dollars, besides paying
eight dollars to the owner of the hog. The punishment for the second and
third offence, of this kind, is the same in the case of a free person,
as of a slave; namely, by the pillory and loss of ears, for the second
offence; the third is declared felony, to which clergy is, however,
allowed. The preceding are the only positive distinctions which now
remain between the punishment of a slave, and a white person, in those
cases, where the latter is liable to a determinate corporal punishment.
But we must not forget, that many actions, which are either not
punishable at all, when perpetrated <span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>[p. 65]</span> by a white person, or at most, by
fine and imprisonment, only, are liable to severe corporal punishment,
when done by a slave; nay, even to death itself, in some cases. To go
abroad without a written permission; to keep or carry a gun, or other
weapon; to utter any seditious speech; to be present at any unlawful
assembly of slaves; to lift the hand in opposition to a white person,
unless wantonly assaulted, are all offences punishable by whipping.
<sup>(68)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>68</sup> 1794. c. 103.</span> To attempt the chastity of a white woman, forcibly, is
punishable by dismemberment: such an attempt would be a high misdemeanor
in a white free man, but the punishment would be far short of that of a
slave. <sup>(69)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>69</sup> Ibidem.</span> To administer medicine without the order or consent of
the master, unless it <i>appear not to have been done with an ill intent</i>;
to <i>consult</i>, advise, or conspire, to rebel or make insurrection; or to
<i>conspire</i>, or <i>plot</i> to <i>murder</i> any person, we have seen, are all
capital offences, from which the benefit of clergy is utterly excluded.
But a <i>bare intention</i> to commit a felony, is not punishable in the case
of a free white man; and even the attempt, if not attended with an
actual breach of the peace, or prevented by such circumstance; only, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>[p. 66]</span> as
do not tend to lessen the guilt of the offender, is at most a
misdemeanor by the common law: and in statutable offences in general, to
consult, advise, and even to procure any person to commit a felony, does
not constitute the crime of felony in the adviser or procurer, unless
the felony be actually perpetrated.</p>

<p>From this view of our jurisprudence respecting slaves, we are
unavoidably led to remark, how frequently the laws of nature have been
set aside in favour of institutions, the pure result of prejudice,
usurpation, and tyranny. We have found actions, innocent, or
indifferent, punishable with a rigour scarcely due to any, but the most
atrocious, offences against civil society; justice distributed by an
unequal measure to the master and the slave; and even the hand of mercy
arrested, where mercy might have been extended to the wretched culprit,
had his complexion been the same with that of his judges: for, the short
period of ten days, between his condemnation and execution, was often
insufficient to obtain a pardon for a slave, convicted in a remote part
of the country, whilst a free man, condemned at the seat of government,
and tried before the governor himself, in whom the power of pardoning
was vested, had a respite <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>[p. 67]</span> of thirty days to implore the clemency of the
executive authority.&mdash;It may be urged, and I believe with truth, that
these rigours do not proceed from a sanguinary temper in the people of
Virginia, but from those political considerations indispensibly
necessary, where slavery prevails to any great extent: I am moreover
happy to observe that our police respecting this unhappy class of
people, is not only less rigorous than formerly, but perhaps milder than
in any other country<a id="FNanchor17" name="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote17" title="Go to footnote 17">[17]</a> where there are so many slaves, or so large a
proportion of them, in respect to the free inhabitants: it is also, I
trust, unjust to censure the present generation for the existence of
slavery in Virginia: for I think it unquestionably true, that a very
large proportion of our fellow-citizens lament that as a misfortune,
which is imputed to them as a reproach; it being evident from what has
been already shewn upon the subject, that, <i>antecedent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>[p. 68]</span> to the
revolution</i>, no exertion to abolish, or even to check the progress of,
slavery, in Virginia, could have received the smallest countenance from
the crown, without whose assent the united wishes and exertions of every
individual here, would have been wholly fruitless and ineffectual: it
is, perhaps, also demonstrable, that at no period since the revolution,
could the abolition of slavery in this state have been safely undertaken
until the foundations of our newly established governments had been
found capable of supporting the fabric itself, under any shock, which so
arduous an attempt might have produced. But these obstacles being now
happily removed, considerations of policy, as well as justice and
humanity, must evince the necessity of eradicating the evil, before it
becomes impossible to do it, without tearing up the roots of civil
society with it.</p>

<p>Having in the preceding part of this enquiry shewn the origin and
foundation of slavery, or the manner in which men have become slaves, as
also who are liable to be retained in slavery, in Virginia, at present,
with the legal consequences attendant upon their condition; it only
remains to consider the mode by which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>[p. 69]</span> slaves have been or may be
emancipated; and the legal consequences thereof, in this
state.&mdash;Manumission, among the Israelites, if the bondman were an
Hebrew, was enjoined after six years' service, by the Mosaical law,
unless the servant chose to continue with his master, in which case the
master carried him before the judges, and took an awl, and thrust it
through his ear into the door, <sup>(70)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>70</sup> Exod. c. 21. Deut. c. 15.</span> and from
thenceforth he became a servant for ever: but if he sent him away free,
he was bound to furnish him liberally out of his flock, and out of his
floor, and out of his wine-press. <sup>(71)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>71</sup> Ibid.</span> Among the Romans, in the time
of the commonwealth, liberty could be conferred only three ways. By
testament, by the <i>census</i>, and by the <i>vindicta</i>, or lictor's rod. A
man was said to be free by the census, "<i>liber censu</i>," when his name
was inserted in the censor's roll, with the approbation of his master.
When he was freed by the vindicta, the master placing his hand upon the
head of the slave, said in the presence of the prætor, it is my desire
that this man may be free, "<i>hunc hominem liberem esse volo</i>;" to which
the prætor replied, I pronounce him free after the manner of the Romans,
"<i>dico cum liberum esse more quiritum</i>."&mdash;then <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>[p. 70]</span> the lictor, receiving the
<i>vindicta</i>, struck the new freed man several blows with it, upon the
head, face, and back, after which his name was registered in the roll of
freed-men, and his head being close shaved, a cap was given him as a
token of liberty. <sup>(72)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>72</sup> Harris's Just. in notes.</span> Under the imperial
constitutions liberty might have been conferred by several other
methods, as in the face of the church, in the presence of friends, or by
letter, or by testament. <sup>(73)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>73</sup> Just. Inst. lib. 1. tit. 5. Ib. lib. 1. tit.
6.</span>&mdash;But it was not in the power of every master to manumit at will;
for if it were done with an intent to defraud creditors, the act was
void; that is, if the master were insolvent at the time of manumission,
or became insolvent by manumission, and intentionally manumitted his
slave for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. A minor, under the
age of twenty years, could not manumit his slave but for a just cause
assigned, which must have been approved by a council, consisting of the
prætor, five senators, and five knights. <sup>(74)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>74</sup> Ib. Harris's Just. in
notes.</span>&mdash;In England, the mode of enfranchising villeins is said to have
been thus prescribed by a law of William the Conqueror. "If any person
is willing to enfranchise his <i>slave</i>, let him, with his right hand,
deliver the slave to the sheriff in a full <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>[p. 71]</span> county, proclaim him exempt
from the bond of servitude by manumission, shew him open gates and ways,
and deliver him <i>free arms</i>, to wit, a lance and a sword; thereupon he
is a free man." <sup>(75)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>75</sup> Harris's Inst. in notes.</span>&mdash;But after that period
freedom was more generally conferred by deed, of which Mr. Harris, in
his notes upon Justinian, has furnished a precedent.</p>

<p>In what manner manumission was performed in this country during the
first century after the introduction of slavery does not appear: the act
of 1668, before mentioned, <sup>(76)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>76</sup> Ante, p. 36.</span> shews it to have been
practised before that period. In 1723 an act was passed, prohibiting the
manumission of slaves, upon any pretence whatsoever, except for
meritorious services, to be adjudged, and allowed by the governor and
council. <sup>(77)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>77</sup> 1723. c. 4.</span> This clause was re-enacted in 1748, and continued
to be the law, until after the revolution was accomplished. The number
of manumissions under such restrictions must necessarily have been very
few. In May 1782 an act passed authorizing, generally, the manumission
of slaves, but requiring such as might be set free, not being of sound
mind or body, or being above the age of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>[p. 72]</span> forty-five years, or males under
twenty-one, or females under eighteen, to be supported by the person
liberating them, or out of his estate. <sup>(78)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>78</sup> May 1782. c. 21.</span> The act of
manumission may be performed either by will, or by deed, under the hand
and seal of the party, acknowledged by him, or proved by two witnesses
in the court of the county where he resides. There is reason to believe
that great numbers have been emancipated since the passing of this act.
By the census of 1791 it appears that the number of free Negroes,
mulattoes and Indians in Virginia, was then 12,866. It would be a large
allowance, to suppose that there were 1800 free Negroes and mulattoes in
Virginia when the act took effect; so that upwards of ten thousand must
have been indebted to it for their freedom.<a id="FNanchor18" name="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote18" title="Go to footnote 18">[18]</a> The number of Indians
and their descendants in Virginia <span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>[p. 73]</span> at present, is too small to require
particular notice. The progress of emancipation in Virginia, is at this
time continual, but not rapid; a second census will enable us to form a
better judgment of it than at present. The act passed in 1792 accords in
some degree with the Justinian code, <sup>(79)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>79</sup> 1794. c. 103.</span> by providing that
slaves emancipated may be taken in execution to satisfy any debt
contracted by the person emancipating them, before such emancipation is
made.<a id="FNanchor19" name="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote19" title="Go to footnote 19">[19]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>[p. 74]</span> <p>Among the Romans, the <i>libertini</i>, or freedmen, were formerly
distinguished by a threefold division. <sup>(80)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>80</sup> Just. Inst. lib. 1. tit. 5.</span>
They sometimes obtained what was called the greater liberty, thereby
becoming <i>Roman citizens</i>. To this privilege, those who were
enfranchised by testament, by the census, or by the vindicta, appear to
have been alone admitted: sometimes they obtained the lesser liberty
only, and became <i>Latins</i>; whose condition is thus described by
Justinian. "They never enjoyed the right of succession. <sup>(81)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>81</sup> to
estates</span>&mdash;For although they led the lives of free men, yet with their
last breath they lost both their lives and liberties; for their
possessions, like the goods of slaves, were detained by the manumittor."
<sup>(82)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>82</sup> Harris's Inst. lib. 3. tit. 8.</span> Sometimes they obtained only the
inferior liberty, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>[p. 75]</span> being called <i>dedititii</i>: such were slaves who had
been condemned as criminals, and afterwards obtained manumission through
the indulgence of their masters: their conditions was equalled with that
of conquered revolters, whom the Romans called, in reproach, <i>dedititii,
quia se suaque omnia dediderunt</i>: but all these distinctions were
abolished by Justinian, <sup>(83)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>83</sup> Inst. lib. 1. tit. 5. s. 3.</span> by whom all freed
men in general were made citizens of Rome, without regard to the form of
manumission.&mdash;In England, the presenting the villein with <i>free arms</i>,
seems to have been the symbol of his restoration to all the rights which
a feudatory was entitled to. With us, we have seen that emancipation
does not confer the rights of citizenship on the person emancipated; on
the contrary, both he and his posterity, of the same complexion with
himself, must always labour under many civil incapacities. If he is
absolved from personal restraint, or corporal punishment, by a master,
yet the laws restrain his actions in many instances, where there is none
upon a free white man. If he can maintain a suit, he cannot be a
witness, a juror, or a judge in any controversy between one of his own
complexion and a white person. If he can <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>[p. 76]</span> acquire property in lands, he
cannot exercise the right of suffrage, which such a property would
confer on his former master; much less can he assist in making those
laws by which he is bound. Yet, even under these disabilities, his
present condition bears an enviable pre-eminence over his former state.
Possessing the liberty of loco-motion, which was formerly denied him, it
is in his choice to submit to that civil inferiority, inseparably
attached to his condition in this country, or seek some more favourable
climate, where all distinctions between men are either totally
abolished, or less regarded than in this.</p>

<p>The extirpation of slavery from the United States, is a task equally
arduous and momentous. To restore the blessings of liberty to near a
million<a id="FNanchor20" name="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote20" title="Go to footnote 20">[20]</a> of oppressed individuals, who have groaned under the yoke of
bondage, and to their descendants, is an object, which those who trust
in Providence, will be convinced would not be unaided by the divine
Author of our being, should we invoke his blessing upon our endeavours.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>[p. 77]</span> Yet human prudence forbids that we should precipitately engage in a work
of such hazard as a general and simultaneous emancipation. The mind of
man must in some measure be formed for his future condition. The early
impressions of obedience and submission, which slaves have received
among us, and the no less habitual arrogance and assumption of
superiority, among the whites, contribute, equally, to unfit the former
for <i>freedom</i>, and the latter for <i>equality</i>.<a id="FNanchor21" name="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21" title="Go to footnote 21">[21]</a> To expel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>[p. 78]</span> them all at
once, from the United States, would in fact be to devote them only to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>[p. 79]</span> a
lingering death by famine, by disease, and other accumulated miseries:
"We have in history but one picture of a similar enterprize, and there
we see it was necessary not only to open the sea by a miracle, for them
to pass, but more necessary to close it again to prevent their return."
<sup>(84)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>84</sup> Letter from Jas. Sullivan, Esq. to Dr. Belknap.</span> To retain them among
us, would be nothing more than to throw so many of the human race upon
the earth without the means of subsistence: they would soon become idle,
profligate, and miserable. Unfit for their new condition, and unwilling
to return to their former laborious course, they would become the
caterpillars of the earth, and the tigers of the human race. The recent
history of the French West Indies exhibits a melancholy picture of the
probable consequences of a general, and momentary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>[p. 80]</span> emancipation in any of
the states, where slavery has made considerable progress. In
Massachusetts the abolition of it was effected by a single stroke; a
clause in their constitution: <sup>(85)</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>85</sup> Dr. Belknap.</span> but the whites at that
time, were as sixty-five to one, in proportion to the blacks. The whole
number of free persons in the United States, south of Delaware state,
are 1,233,829, end there are 648,439 slaves; the proportion being less
than two to one. Of the cultivators of the earth in the same district,
it is probable that there are four slaves for one free white man.&mdash;&mdash;To
discharge the former from their present condition, would be attended
with an immediate general famine, in those parts of the United States,
from which not all the productions of the other states, could deliver
them; similar evils might reasonably be apprehended from the adoption of
the measure by any one of the southern states; for in all of them the
proportion of slaves is too great, not to be attended with calamitous
effects, if they were immediately set free.<a id="FNanchor22" name="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22" title="Go to footnote 22">[22]</a> These are serious, I had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>[p. 81]</span> almost said unsurmountable obstacles, to general, simultaneous
emancipation.&mdash;There are other considerations not to be disregarded. A
great part of the <i>property</i> of individuals consists in <i>slaves</i>. The
laws have sanctioned this species of property. Can the laws take away
the property of an individual without his own consent, or without a
<i>just compensation</i>? Will those who do not hold slaves agree to be taxed
to make this compensation? Creditors also, who have trusted their
debtors upon the faith of this visible property will be defrauded. If
justice demands the emancipation of the slave, she also, <i>under these
circumstances</i>, seems to plead for the owner, and for his creditor. The
claims of nature, it will be said are stronger than those which arise
from social institutions, only. I admit it, but nature also dictates to
us to provide for our <i>own</i> safety, and authorizes all <i>necessary</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>[p. 82]</span> measures for that purpose. And we have shewn that our own security, nay,
our very existence, might be endangered by the hasty adoption of any
measure for the <i>immediate</i> relief of the <i>whole</i> of this unhappy race.
Must we then quit the subject, in despair of the success of any project
for the amendment of their, as well as our own, condition? I think
not.&mdash;Strenuously as I feel my mind opposed to a simultaneous
emancipation, for the reasons already mentioned, the abolition of
slavery in the United States, and especially in that state, to which I
am attached by every tie that nature and society form, is <i>now</i> my
<i>first</i>, and will probably be my last, expiring wish. But here let me
avoid the imputation of inconsistency, by observing, that the abolition
of slavery may be effected without the <i>emancipation</i> of a single slave;
without depriving any man of the <i>property</i> which he <i>possesses</i>, and
without defrauding a creditor who has trusted him on the faith of that
property. The experiment in that mode has already been begun in some of
our sister states. Pennsylvania, under the auspices of the immortal
Franklin,<a id="FNanchor23" name="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" title="Go to footnote 23">[23]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>[p. 83]</span> begun the work of gradual abolition of slavery in the year
1780, by enlisting nature herself, on the side of humanity. Connecticut
followed the example four years after.<a id="FNanchor24" name="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" title="Go to footnote 24">[24]</a> New-York very lately made an
essay which miscarried by a very inconsiderable majority. Mr. Jefferson
informs us, that the committee of revisors, of which he was a member,
had prepared a bill for the emancipation of all slaves born after
passing that act. This is conformable to the Pennsylvania and
Connecticut laws.&mdash;Why the measure was not brought forward in the
general assembly I have never heard. Possibly because objections were
foreseen to that part of the bill which relates to the disposal of the
blacks, after they had attained a certain age.<a id="FNanchor25" name="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25" title="Go to footnote 25">[25]</a> It certainly seems
liable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>[p. 84]</span> to many, both as to the policy and the practicability of it. To
establish such a colony in the territory of the United States, would
probably lay the foundation of intestine wars, which would terminate
only in their extirpation, or final expulsion. To attempt it in any
other quarter of the globe would be attended with the utmost cruelty to
the colonists, themselves, and the destruction of their whole race. If
the plan were at this moment in operation, it would require the annual
exportation of 12,000 persons. This requisite number must, for a series
of years be considerably increased, in order to keep pace with the
increasing population of those people. In twenty years it would amount
to upwards of twenty thousand persons; which is half the number which
are now supposed to be annually <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>[p. 85]</span> exported from Africa.&mdash;Where would a
fund to support this expence be found? Five times the present revenue of
the state would barely defray the charge of their passage. Where
provisions for their support after their arrival? Where those
necessaries which must preserve them from perishing?&mdash;Where a territory
sufficient to support them?&mdash;Or where could they be received as friends,
and not as invaders? To colonize them in the United States might seem
less difficult. If the territory to be assigned them were beyond the
settlements of the whites, would they not be put upon a forlorn hope
against the Indians? Would not the expence of transporting them thither,
and supporting them, at least for the first and second year, be also far
beyond the revenues and abilities of the state? The expence attending a
small army in that country hath been found enormous. To transport as
many colonists, annually, as we have shewn were necessary to eradicate
the evil, would probably require five times as much money as the support
of such an army. But the expence would not stop there: they must be
assisted and supported at least for another year after their arrival in
their new settlements. Suppose them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>[p. 86]</span> arrived. Illiterate and ignorant as
they are, is it probable that they would be capable of instituting such
a government, in their new colony, as would be necessary for their own
internal happiness, or to secure them from destruction from without?
European emigrants, from whatever country they arrive, have been
accustomed to the restraint of laws, and to respect for government.
These people, accustomed to be ruled with a rod of iron, will not easily
submit to milder restraints. They would become hordes of vagabonds,
robbers and murderers. Without the aids of an enlightened policy,
morality, or religion, what else could be expected from their still
savage state, and debased condition?&mdash;"But why not retain and
<i>incorporate</i> the <i>blacks into the state</i>?" This question has been well
answered by Mr. Jefferson,<a id="FNanchor26" name="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote26" title="Go to footnote 26">[26]</a> and who is there so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>[p. 87]</span> free from prejudices
among us, as candidly to declare that he has none against <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>[p. 88]</span> such a
measure? The recent scenes transacted in the French colonies in the West
Indies are enough to make one shudder with the apprehension of realizing
similar calamities in this country. Such probably would be the event of
an attempt to smother those prejudices which have been cherished for a
period of almost two centuries. Those who secretly favour, whilst they
affect to regret, domestic slavery, contend that in abolishing it, we
must also abolish that scion from it which I have denominated <i>civil</i>
slavery. That there must be no distinction of rights; that the
descendants of Africans, as men, have an equal claim to all civil
rights, as the descendants of Europeans; and upon being delivered from
the yoke of bondage have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>[p. 89]</span> a right to be admitted to all the privileges of
a citizen.&mdash;But have not men when they enter into a state of society, a
right to admit, or exclude any description of persons, as they think
proper? If it be true, as Mr. Jefferson seems to suppose, that the
Africans are really an inferior race of mankind,<a id="FNanchor27" name="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote27" title="Go to footnote 27">[27]</a> will not sound
policy advise their exclusion from a society in which they have not yet
been admitted to participate in civil rights; and even to guard against
such admission, at any future period, since it may eventually depreciate
the whole national character? And if prejudices have taken such deep
root in our minds, as to render it impossible to eradicate this opinion,
ought not so general an error, if it be one, to be respected? Shall we
not relieve the necessities of the naked diseased beggar, unless we will
invite him to a seat at our table; nor afford him shelter from the
inclemencies of the night air, unless we admit him also <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>[p. 90]</span> to share our
bed? To deny that we ought to abolish slavery, without incorporating the
Negroes into the state, and admitting them to a full participation of
all our civil and social rights, appears to me to rest upon a similar
foundation. The experiment so far as it has been already made among us,
proves that the emancipated blacks are not ambitious of civil rights. To
prevent the generation of such an ambition, appears to comport with
sound policy; for if it should ever rear its head, its partizans, as
well as its opponents, will be enlisted by nature herself, and always
ranged in formidable array against each other. We must therefore
endeavour to find some middle course, between the tyrannical and
iniquitous policy which holds so many human creatures in a state of
grievous bondage, and that which would turn loose a numerous, starving,
and enraged banditti, upon the innocent descendants of their former
oppressors. <i>Nature</i>, <i>time</i>, and <i>sound policy</i> must co-operate with
each other to produce such a change: if either be neglected, the work
will be incomplete, dangerous, and not improbably destructive.</p>

<p>The plan therefore which I would presume to propose for the
consideration of my <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>[p. 91]</span> countrymen is such, as the number of slaves, the
difference of their nature, and habits, and the state of agriculture,
among us, might render it <i>expedient</i>, rather than <i>desirable</i> to adopt:
and would partake partly of that proposed by Mr. Jefferson, and adopted
in other states; and partly of such cautionary restrictions, as a due
regard to situation and circumstances, and even to <i>general</i> prejudices,
might recommend to those, who engage in so arduous, and perhaps
unprecedented an undertaking.</p>

<p>1. Let every female born after the adoption of the plan be free,
  and transmit freedom to all her descendants, both male and female.</p>

<p>2. As a compensation to those persons, in whose families such
  females, or their descendants may be born, for the expence and
  trouble of their maintenance during infancy, let them serve such
  persons until the age of twenty-eight years: let them then receive
  twenty dollars in money, two suits of clothes, suited to the
  season, a hat, a pair of shoes, and two blankets. If these things
  be not voluntarily done, let the county courts enforce the
  performance, upon complaint.</p>

<p>3. Let all Negroe children be registered with the clerk of the
  county or corporation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>[p. 92]</span> court, where born, within one month after
  their birth: let the person in whose family they are born take a
  copy of the register, and deliver it to the mother, or if she die
  to the child, before it is of the age of twenty-one years. Let any
  Negroe claiming to be free, and above the age of puberty, be
  considered as of the age of twenty-eight years, if he or she be
  not registered, as required.</p>

<p>4. Let all such Negroe servants be put on the same footing as
  white servants and apprentices now are, in respect to food,
  raiment, correction, and the assignment of their service from one
  to another.</p>

<p>5. Let the children of Negroes and mulattoes, born in the families
  of their parents, be bound to service by the overseers of the
  poor, until they shall attain the age of twenty-one years.&mdash;Let
  all above that age, who are not housekeepers, nor have voluntarily
  bound themselves to service for a year before the first day of
  February annually, be then bound for the remainder of the year by
  the overseers of the poor. Let the overseers of the poor receive
  fifteen per cent. of their wages, from the person hiring them, as
  a compensation for their trouble, and ten per cent. per annum out
  of the wages <span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>[p. 93]</span> of such as they may bind apprentices.</p>

<p>6. If at the age of twenty-seven years, the master of a Negroe or
  mulattoe servant be unwilling to pay his freedom dues, above
  mentioned, at the expiration of the succeeding year, let him bring
  him into the county court, clad and furnished with necessaries as
  before directed, and pay into court five dollars, for the use of
  the servant, and thereupon let the court direct him to be hired by
  the overseers of the poor for the succeeding year, in the manner
  before directed.</p>

<p>7. Let no Negroe or mulattoe be capable of taking, holding, or
  exercising, any public office, freehold, franchise or privilege,
  or any estate in lands or tenements, other than a lease not
  exceeding twenty-one years.&mdash;Nor of keeping, or bearing arms,<a id="FNanchor28" name="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote28" title="Go to footnote 28">[28]</a>
  unless authorised so to do by some act of the general assembly,
  whose duration shall be limitted to three years. Nor of
  contracting matrimony with any other than a Negroe or mulattoe;
  nor be an attorney; nor be a juror; nor a witness in any court of
  judicature, except against; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>[p. 94]</span> or between Negroes and mulattoes. Nor
  be an executor or administrator; nor capable of making any will or
  testament; nor maintain any real action; nor be a trustee of lands
  or tenements himself, nor any other person to be a trustee to him
  or to his use.</p>

<p>8. Let all persons born after the passing of the act, be
  considered as entitled to the same mode of trial in criminal
  cases, as free Negroes and mulattoes are now entitled to.</p>

<p>The restrictions in this place may appear to favour strongly of
prejudice: whoever proposes any plan for the abolition of slavery, will
find that he must either encounter, or accommodate himself to
prejudice.&mdash;I have preferred the latter; not that I pretend to be wholly
exempt from it, but that I might avoid as many obstacles as possible to
the completion of so desirable a work, as the abolition of slavery.
Though I am opposed to the banishment of the Negroes, I wish not to
encourage their future residence among us. By denying them the most
valuable privileges which civil government affords, I wished to render
it their inclination and their interest to seek those privileges in some
other climate. There <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>[p. 95]</span> is an immense unsettled territory on this
continent<a id="FNanchor29" name="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote29" title="Go to footnote 29">[29]</a> more congenial to their natural constitutions than ours,
where they may perhaps be received upon more favourable terms than we
can permit them to remain with us. Emigrating in small numbers, they
will be able to effect settlements more easily than in large numbers;
and without the expence or danger of numerous colonies. By releasing
them from the yoke of bondage, and enabling them to seek happiness
wherever they can hope to find it, we surely confer a benefit, which no
one can sufficiently appreciate, who has not tasted of the bitter curse
of compulsory servitude. By excluding them from offices, the seeds of
ambition would be buried too deep, ever to germinate: by disarming them,
we may calm our apprehensions of their resentments arising from past
sufferings; by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>[p. 96]</span> incapacitating them from holding lands, we should add one
inducement more to emigration, and effectually remove the foundation of
ambition, and party-struggles. Their personal rights, and their
property, though limited, would whilst they remain among us be under the
protection of the laws; and their condition not at all inferior to that
of the <i>labouring</i> poor in most other countries. Under such an
arrangement we might reasonably hope, that time would either remove from
us a race of men, whom we wish not to incorporate with us, or obliterate
those prejudices, which now form an obstacle to such incorporation.</p>

<p>But it is not from the want of liberality to the emancipated race of
blacks that I apprehend the most serious objections to the plan I have
ventured to suggest.&mdash;Those slave holders (whose numbers I trust are
few) who have been in the habit of considering their fellow creatures as
no more than cattle, and the rest of the brute creation, will exclaim
that they are to be deprived of their <i>property</i>, without compensation.
Men who will shut their ears against this moral truth, that all men are
by nature <i>free</i>, and <i>equal</i>, will not even be convinced that they do
not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97"></a>[p. 97]</span> possess a <i>property</i> in an <i>unborn</i> child: they will not distinguish
between allowing to <i>unborn</i> generations the absolute and unalienable
rights of human nature, and taking away that which they <i>now possess</i>;
they will shut their ears against truth, should you tell them, the loss
of the mother's labour for nine months, and the maintenance of a child
for a dozen or fourteen years, is amply compensated by the services of
that child for as many years more, as he has been an expence to them.
But if the voice of reason, justice and humanity be not stifled by
sordid avarice, or unfeeling tyranny, it would be easy to convince even
those who have entertained such erroneous notions, that the right of one
man over another is neither founded in nature, nor in sound policy. That
it cannot extend to those <i>not in being</i>; that no man can in reality be
<i>deprived</i> of what he doth not possess: that fourteen years labour by a
young person in the prime of life, is an ample compensation for a few
months of labour lost by the mother, and for the maintenance of a child,
in that coarse homely manner that Negroes are brought up: And lastly,
that a state of slavery is not only perfectly incompatible with the
principles of government, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>[p. 98]</span> but with the safety and security of their
masters. History evinces this. At this moment we have the most awful
demonstrations of it. Shall we then neglect a duty, which every
consideration, moral, religious, political, or <i>selfish</i>, recommends.
Those who wish to postpone the measure, do not reflect that every day
renders the task more arduous to be performed. We have now 300,000
slaves among us. Thirty years hence we shall have double the number. In
sixty years we shall have 1,200,000. And in less than another century
from this day, even that enormous number will be doubled. Milo acquired
strength enough to carry an ox, by beginning with the ox while he was
yet a calf. If we complain that the calf is too heavy for our shoulders,
what will not the ox be?</p>

<p>To such as apprehend danger to our agricultural interest, and the
depriving the families of those whose principal reliance is upon their
slaves, of support, it will be proper to submit a view of the gradual
operation, and effects of this plan. They will no doubt be surprized to
hear, that whenever it is adopted, the number of slaves will not be
diminished for forty years after it takes place; that it will even
encrease for thirty years; that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>[p. 99]</span> at the distance of sixty years, there
will be one-third of the number at its first commencement: that it will
require <i>above a century</i> to complete it; and that the number of blacks
<i>under twenty-eight</i>, and consequently bound to service, in the families
they are born in, will always be at least as great, as the present
number of slaves. These circumstances I trust will remove many
objections, and that they are truly stated will appear upon enquiry.<a id="FNanchor30" name="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote30" title="Go to footnote 30">[30]</a>
It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>[p. 100]</span> will further appear, that females only will arrive at the age of
emancipation within the first forty-five years; all the males during
that period, continuing either in slavery, or bound to service till <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>[p. 101]</span> the
age of twenty-eight years. The earth cannot want cultivators, whilst our
population increases as at present, and three-fourths of those employed
therein are held to service, and the remainder compellable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>[p. 102]</span> to labour.
For we must not lose sight of this important consideration, that these
people must be <i>bound</i> to labour, if they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>[p. 103]</span> do not <i>voluntarily</i> engage
therein. Their faculties are at present only calculated for that object;
if they be not employed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>[p. 104]</span> therein they will become drones of the worst
description. In absolving them from the yoke of slavery, we must not
forget the interests of the society. Those interests require the
exertions of every individual in some mode or other; and those who have
not wherewith to support themselves honestly without corporal labour,
whatever be their complexion, ought to be compelled to labour. This is
the case in England, where domestic slavery has long been unknown. It
must also be the case in every well ordered society; and where the
numbers of persons without property increase, there the coertion of the
laws becomes more immediately requisite. The proposed plan would
necessarily have this effect, and therefore ought to be accompanied with
such a regulation. Though the rigours of our police in respect to this
unhappy race ought <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>[p. 105]</span> to be softened, yet, its regularity, and punctual
administration should be increased, rather than relaxed. If we doubt the
propriety of such measures, what must we think of the situation of our
country, when instead of 300,000, we shall have more than <i>two millions</i>
of <span class="smcap">SLAVES</span> among us? This <i>must happen within a</i> <span class="smcap">CENTURY</span>, if we do not
set about the abolition of slavery. Will not our posterity curse the
days of their nativity with all the anguish of Job? Will they not
execrate the memory of those ancestors, who, having it in their power to
avert evil, have, like their first parents, entailed a curse upon all
future generations? We know that the rigour of the laws respecting
slaves unavoidably must increase with their numbers: What a
blood-stained code must that be which is calculated for the restraint of
<i>millions</i> held in bondage! Such must our unhappy country exhibit within
a century, unless we are both wise and just enough to avert from
posterity the calamity and reproach, which are otherwise unavoidable.</p>

<p>I am not vain enough to presume the plan I have suggested entirely free
from objection; nor that in offering my own ideas on the subject, I have
been more <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>[p. 106]</span> fortunate than others: but from the communication of sentiment
between those who lament the evil, it is possible that an effectual
remedy may at length be discovered. Whenever that happens the golden age
of our country will begin. Till then,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote8" id="Footnote8"></a><a href="#FNanchor8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> "About the same time (the reign of queen Elizabeth) a
  traffic in the human species, called Negroes, was introduced into
  England, which is one of the most odious and unnatural branches of
  trade the sordid and avaricious mind of mortals ever invented.&mdash;It
  had been carried on before this period by Genoese traders, who
  bought a patent from Charles the fifth, containing an exclusive
  right of carrying Negroes from the Portuguese settlements in
  Africa, to America and the West Indies; but the English nation had
  not yet engaged in the iniquitous traffic.&mdash;One William Hawkins,
  an expert English seaman, having made several voyages to the coast
  of Guinea, and from thence to Brazil and the West Indies, had
  acquired considerable knowledge of the countries. At his death he
  left his journals with his son, John Hawkins, in which he
  described the lands of America and the West Indies as exceedingly
  rich and fertile, but utterly neglected for want of hands to
  improve them. He represented the natives of Europe as unequal to
  the task in such a scorching climate; but those of Africa as well
  adapted to undergo the labours requisite. Upon which John Hawkins
  immediately formed a design of transporting Africans into the
  western world; and having drawn a plan for the execution of it, he
  laid it before some of his opulent neighbours for encouragement
  and approbation. To them it appeared promising and advantageous. A
  subscription was opened and speedily filled up, by Sir Lionel
  Ducket, Sir Thomas Lodge, Sir William Winter, and others, who
  plainly perceived the vast profits that would result from such a
  trade. Accordingly three ships were fitted out, and manned by an
  hundred select sailors, whom Hawkins encouraged to go with him by
  promises of good treatment and great pay. In the year 1562 he set
  sail for Africa, and in a few weeks arrived at the country called
  Sierra Leona, where he began his commerce with the Negroes. While
  he trafficked with them, he found the means of giving them a
  charming description of the country to which he was bound; the
  unsuspicious Africans listened to him with apparent joy and
  satisfaction, and seemed remarkably fond of his European trinkets,
  food, and clothes. He pointed out to them the barrenness of the
  country, and their naked and wretched condition, and promised if
  any of them were weary of their miserable circumstances, and would
  go along with him, he would carry them to a plentiful land, where
  they should <i>live happy</i>, and <i>receive</i> an abundant <i>recompence</i>
  for their labours. He told them the country was inhabited by such
  men as himself and his jovial companions, and <i>assured</i> them of
  <i>kind usage</i> and <i>great friendship</i>. In short, the Negroes were
  overcome by his flattering promises, and <i>three hundred</i> stout
  fellows accepted his offer, and consented to embark along with
  him. Every thing being settled on the most amicable terms between
  them, Hawkins made preparations for his voyage. But in the night
  before his departure his Negroes were attacked by a large body
  from a different quarter; Hawkins, being alarmed with the shrieks
  and cries of dying persons, ordered his men to the assistance of
  his slaves, and having surrounded the assailants, carried a number
  of them on board as prisoners of war. The next day he set sail for
  Hispaniola with his cargo of human creatures; but during the
  passage, he treated the prisoners of war in a different manner
  from his volunteers. Upon his arrival he disposed of his cargo to
  great advantage; and endeavoured to inculcate on the Spaniards who
  bought the negroes the same distinction to be observed: but they
  having <i>purchased all at the same rate</i>, considered them as slaves
  of the same condition, and consequently treated all alike."</p>

<p>Hawkins having returned to England, soon after made preparations
  for a second voyage. "In his passage he fell in with the Minion
  man of war, which accompanied him to the Coast of Africa. After
  his arrival he began as formerly to traffic with the Negroes,
  endeavouring by persuasions and <i>prospects</i> of <i>reward</i>, to induce
  them to go along with him&mdash;but now they were more reserved and
  jealous of his designs, and as none of their neighbours had
  returned, they were apprehensive he had killed and eat them. The
  crew of the man of war observing the Africans backward and
  suspicious, began to laugh at his gentle and dilatory methods of
  proceeding, and proposed having immediate recourse to force and
  compulsion&mdash;but Hawkins considered it as cruel and unjust, and
  tried by persuasions, promises and threats, to prevail on them to
  desist from a purpose so unwarrantable and barbarous. In vain did
  he urge his authority and instructions from the Queen: the bold
  and headstrong sailors would hear of no restraints. Drunkenness
  and avarice are deaf to the voice of humanity. They pursue their
  violent design, and, after several unsuccessful attacks, in which
  <i>many</i> of them lost their <i>lives</i>, the cargo was at length
  compleated by barbarity and force.</p>

<p>"Hence arose that horrid and inhuman practice of dragging Africans
  into slavery, which has since been <i>so</i> pursued, in defiance of
  every principle of justice and religion. Had Negroes been brought
  from the flames, to which in some countries they were devoted on
  their falling prisoners of war, and in others, sacrificed at the
  funeral obsequies of the great and powerful among themselves; in
  short had they by this traffic been delivered from <i>torture</i> or
  <i>death</i>, European merchants <i>might have some excuse</i> to plead in
  its vindication. <i>But according to the common mode in which it has
  been conducted</i>, we must confess it a difficult matter to conceive
  a <i>single</i> argument in its defence. And though policy has given
  countenance and sanction to the trade, yet every candid and
  impartial man must confess, that it is atrocious and unjustifiable
  in every light in which it can be viewed, and turns merchants into
  a band of robbers, and trade into atrocious acts of fraud and
  violence." Historical Account of South-Carolina and Georgia.

<p>"The number of Negroe slaves bartered for in one year (viz. 1768),
  on the Coast of Africa from Cape Blanco, to Rio Congo, amounted to
  104,000 souls, whereof more than half (viz. 53,000) were shipped
  on account of British merchants, and 6,300 on the account of
  British Americans." The Law of Retribution by Granville Sharpe,
  Esq. page 147. note.</p>

  Sharpe, Esq. of London.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote10" id="Footnote10"></a><a href="#FNanchor10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The condition of a <i>villein</i> had most of the
  incidents I have before described in giving the idea of <i>slavery</i>,
  in general. His services were uncertain and indeterminate, such as
  his lord thought fit to require; or as some of our ancient writers
  express it, he knew not in the evening what he was to do in the
  morning, he was bound to do whatever he was commanded. He was
  liable to beating, imprisonment, and every other chastisement his
  lord could devise, except killing and maiming. He was incapable of
  acquiring property for his own benefit; he was himself the subject
  of property; as such saleable and transmissible. If he was a
  villein regardant he passed with the land to which he was annexed,
  but might be severed at the will of his lord; if he was a villein
  in gross, he was an hereditament, or a chattel real, according to
  his lord's interest; being descendible to the heir, where the lord
  was absolute <i>owner</i>, and transmissible to the executor where the
  lord had only a term of years in him. Lastly, the slavery extended
  to the issue, if the father was a villein, our law deriving the
  condition of the child from that of the father, contrary to the
  Roman law, in which the rule was, <i>partus sequitur ventum</i>.
  Hargrave's Case of Negroe Somerset, page 26 and 27.</p>

<p>The same writer refers the origin of vassalage in England,
  principally to the wars between the British, Saxon, Danish, and
  Norman nations, contending for the sovereignty of that country, in
  opposition to the opinion of judge Fitzherbert, who supposes
  villeinage to have commenced at the conquest. Ib. 27, 28. And this
  he proves from Spelman and other antiquaries. Ib. The writ <i>de
  nativo habendo</i>, by which the lord was enabled to recover his
  villein that had absconded from him, creates a presumption that
  all the natives of England were at some period reduced to a state
  of villeinage, the word <i>nativus</i>, which signified a villein, most
  clearly designating the person meant thereby to be a <i>native</i>:
  this etymon is obvious, as well from the import of the word
  <i>nativus</i>, as from the history of the more remote ages of Britain.
  Sir Edward Coke's Etymology, "<i>quia plerumque nascuntur servi</i>,"
  is one of those puerile conceits, which so frequently occur in his
  works, and are unworthy of so great a man.</p>

<p>Barrington in his observations upon <i>magna carta</i> c. 4. observes,
  that the villeins who held by servile tenures were considered as
  so many negroes on a sugar plantation; the words "<i>liber homo</i>,"
  in magna carta, c. 14. with all deference to sir Edward Coke, who
  says they mean a <i>free-holder</i>, I understand as meaning <i>a free
  man</i>,[Liber homo, &amp;c. the title of <i>freeman</i> was formerly
  <i>confined</i> to the <i>nobility</i> and <i>gentry</i> who were <i>descended</i> of
  free ancestors.&mdash;Burgh's Political Disquisitions, vol. iii. p.
  400, who cites Spelman's Glossary, voc. Liber homo.] as
  contradistinguished from a <i>villein</i>: for in the very next
  sentence the words "et <i>villanus</i> alterius quam noster," occur.
  Villeins must certainly have been numerous at that day, to have
  obtained a place in the Great Charter. It is no less an evidence
  that their condition was in a state of melioration.</p>

<p>In Poland, at this day, the peasants seem to be in an absolute
  state of slavery, or at least of villeinage, to the nobility, who
  are the land-holders.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote11" id="Footnote11"></a><a href="#FNanchor11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Among the Israelites, according to the Mosaical law,
  "If a man smote his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he died
  under his hand, he should surely be punished&mdash;notwithstanding if
  he continue a day or two, he should not be punished [Exod. c.
  21]:" for, saith the text, he is <i>his money</i>. Our legislators
  appear to have adopted the reason of the latter clause, without
  the humanity of the former part of the law.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote12" id="Footnote12"></a><a href="#FNanchor12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Hannah and other Indians, against Davis.&mdash;Since this
  adjudication, I have met with a manuscript act of assembly made in
  1691 c. 9 entitled, "An Act for a free Trade with Indians," the
  enacting clause of which is in the very words of the act of 1705.
  c. 52. A similar title to an act of that session occurs in the
  edition of 1733. p. 94. and the chapter is numbered as in the
  manuscript. If this manuscript be authentic (which there is some
  reason to presume, it being copied in some blank leaves at the end
  of Purvis's edition, and apparently written about the time of the
  passage of the act), it would seem that no Indians brought into
  Virginia for more than a century, nor any of their descendents,
  can be retained in slavery in this commonwealth.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote13" id="Footnote13"></a><a href="#FNanchor13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Although it be true that the number of slaves in the
  <i>whole</i> state bears the proportion of 292,427, to 747,610, the
  whole number of souls in the state, that is, nearly as <i>two</i> to
  <i>five</i>; yet this proportion is by no means <i>uniform</i> throughout
  the state. In the forty-four counties lying upon the Bay, and the
  great rivers of the state, and comprehended by a line including
  Brunswick, Cumberland, Goochland, Hanover, Spottsylvania,
  Stafford, Prince William and Fairfax, and the counties eastward
  thereof, the number of slaves is 196,542, and the number of free
  persons, including free Negroes and mulattoes, 198,371 only. So
  that the blacks in that populous and extensive district of country
  are <i>more numerous</i> than the whites. In the second class,
  comprehending nineteen counties, and extending from the last
  mentioned line to the Blue Ridge, and including the populous
  counties of Frederick and Berkeley, beyond the Blue Ridge, there
  are 82,286 slaves, and 136,251 free persons; the number of free
  persons in that class not being two to one, to the slaves. In the
  third class the proportion is considerably increased; the eleven
  counties of which it consists contain only 11,218 slaves, and
  76,281 free persons. This class reaches to the Allegany ridge of
  mountains: the fourth and last class, comprehending fourteen
  counties westward of the third class, contains only 2,381 slaves,
  and 42,288 free persons. It is obvious from this statement that
  almost all the dangers and inconveniences which may be apprehended
  from a state of slavery on the one hand, or an attempt to abolish
  it, on the other, will be confined to the people eastward of the
  blue ridge of mountains.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote15" id="Footnote15"></a><a href="#FNanchor15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> <span style="font-size: 1.8em;">&#9758;</span> The following extract from a petition to the
  throne, presented from the house of burgesses of Virginia, April
  1, 1772, will shew the sense of the people of Virginia on the
  subject of slavery at that period.</p>

<p>"The many instances of your majesty's benevolent intentions and
  more gracious disposition to promote the prosperity and happiness
  of your subjects in the colonies, encourages us to look up to the
  throne, and implore your majesty's paternal assistance in averting
  a calamity of a most alarming nature."</p>

<p>"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of
  Africa hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity,
  and under its <i>present encouragement</i>, we have too much reason to
  fear <i>will endanger the very existence</i> of your majesty's American
  dominions."</p>

<p>"We are sensible that some of your majesty's subjects of <i>Great
  Britain</i> may reap emoluments from this sort of traffic, but when
  we consider that it greatly retards the settlement of the
  colonies, with <i>more useful</i> inhabitants, and may, in time, have
  the most destructive influence, we presume to hope that the
  <i>interest of a few</i> be disregarded when placed in competition with
  the security and happiness of such numbers of your majesty's
  dutiful and loyal subjects."</p>

<p>"Deeply impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech
  your majesty to <i>remove all those restraints</i> on your majesty's
  governors of this colony, <i>which inhibit their assenting to such
  laws as might check so very pernicious a commerce</i>." Journals of
  the House of Burgesses, page 131.</p>

<p>This petition produced no effect, as appears from the first clause
  of our <span class="smcap">constitution</span>, where among other acts of misrule, "the
  inhuman use of the royal negative" in refusing us permission to
  exclude slaves from among us by law, is enumerated, among the
  reasons for <i>separating from Great Britain</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote16" id="Footnote16"></a><a href="#FNanchor16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> In December term 1788, one John Huston was tried in
  the general court for the murder of a slave; the jury found him
  guilty of manslaughter, and the court, upon a motion in arrest of
  judgment, discharged him without any punishment. The general
  assembly being then sitting, some of the members of the court
  mentioned the case to some leading characters in the legislature,
  and the act was at the same session repealed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote17" id="Footnote17"></a><a href="#FNanchor17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> See Jefferson's Notes, 259.&mdash;The Marquis de
  Chatelleux's Travels, I have not noted the page; the Law of

<p><a name="Footnote18" id="Footnote18"></a><a href="#FNanchor18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> There are <i>more</i> free Negroes and mulattoes in
  Virginia alone, than are to be found in the four New-England
  states, and Vermont in addition to them. The progress of
  emancipation in this state is therefore much greater than our
  <i>Eastern</i> brethren may at first suppose. There are only 1087 free
  Negroes and mulattoes in the States of New-York, New-Jersey and
  Pennsylvania, <i>more</i>, than in Virginia. Those who take a subject
  in the gross, have little idea of the result of an exact scrutiny.
  Out of 20,348 inhabitants on the Eastern Shore of Virginia 1185
  were free Negroes and mulattoes when the census was taken. The
  number is since much augmented.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote19" id="Footnote19"></a><a href="#FNanchor19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The act of 1795. c. 11. enacts, that any person held
  in slavery may make complaint to a magistrate, or to the court of
  the district county or corporation wherein he resides, and not
  elsewhere. The magistrate, if the complaint be made to him, shall
  issue his warrant to summon the owner before him, and compel him
  to give bond and security to suffer the complainant to appear at
  the next court to petition the court to be admitted to sue <i>in
  forma pauperis</i>. If the owner refuse, the magistrate shall order
  the complainant into the custody of the officer serving the
  warrant, at the expence of the master, who shall keep him until
  the sitting of the court, and then produce him before it. Upon
  petition to the court, if the court be satisfied as to the
  material facts, they shall assign the complainant council, who
  shall state the facts with his opinion thereon to the court; and
  unless from the circumstances so stated, and the opinion thereon
  given, the court shall <i>see manifest reason to deny their
  interference</i>, they shall order the clerk to issue process against
  the owner, and the complainant shall remain in the custody of the
  sheriff until the owner shall give bond and security to have him
  forthcoming to answer the judgment of the court. And by the
  general law in case of pauper's suits; the complainants shall have
  writs of subpoena gratis; and by the practice of the courts, he is
  permitted to attend the taking the depositions of witnesses, and
  go and come freely to and from court, for the prosecution of his
  suit.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote20" id="Footnote20"></a><a href="#FNanchor20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The number of slaves in the United States at the
  time of the late census, was something under 700,000.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote21" id="Footnote21"></a><a href="#FNanchor21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Mr. Jefferson most forcibly paints the unhappy
  influence on the manners of the people produced by the existence
  of slavery among us. The whole commerce between master and slave,
  says he, is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions,
  the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading
  submissions on the other. Our children see this, and learn to
  imitate it; for man is an imitative animal. This quality is the
  germ of education in him. From his cradle to his grave he is
  learning what he sees others do. If a parent had no other motive
  either in his own philanthropy or his self love, for restraining
  the intemperance of passion towards his slave, it should always be
  a sufficient one that his child is present. But generally it is
  not sufficient. The parent storms, the child looks on, catches the
  lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of
  smaller slaves, gives a loose to his worst of passions; and thus
  nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be
  stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy
  who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such
  circumstances. And with what execrations would the statesman be
  loaded, who permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on
  the rights of the other, transforms them into despots, and these
  into enemies, destroys the morals of the one part, and the amor
  patriæ of the other. For if a slave can have a country in this
  world, it must be any other in preference to that in which he is
  born to live and labour for another; in which he must lock up the
  faculties of his nature, contribute as far as depends on his
  individual endeavours to the evanishment of the human race, or
  entail his own miserable condition on the endless generations
  proceeding from him. With the morals of the people, their industry
  also, is destroyed. For in a warm climate, no man will labour for
  himself who can make another labour for him. This is so true, that
  of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are
  ever seen to labour. And can the liberties of a nation be ever
  thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a
  conviction in the minds of the people, that these liberties are of
  the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his
  wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is
  just: that his justice cannot sleep for ever: that considering
  numbers, nature, and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel
  of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible events:
  that it may become probable by supernatural interference! The
  Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a
  contest.&mdash;But it is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this
  subject through the various considerations of policy, of morals,
  of history, natural and civil. We must be contented to hope they
  will force their way into every one's mind. I think a change
  already perceptible, since the origin of the present revolution.
  The spirit of the master is abating, that of the slave rising from
  the dust; his condition mollifying; the way I hope preparing,
  under the auspices of Heaven, for a total emancipation, and that
  this is disposed in the order of events, to be with the consent of
  their masters, rather than by their extirpation. Notes on
  Virginia, 298.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote22" id="Footnote22"></a><a href="#FNanchor22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> What is here advanced is not to be understood as
  implying an opinion that the labour of slaves is more productive
  than that of freemen.&mdash;The author of the Treatise on the Wealth of
  Nations, informs us, "That it appears from the experience of all
  ages and nations, that the work done by freemen comes cheaper in
  the end than that done by slaves. That it is found to do so, even
  in Boston, New-York and Philadelphia, where the wages of common
  labour are very high." Vol. 1. pa. 123. Lond. edit. oct. Admitting
  this conclusion, it would not remove the objection that
  emancipated slaves would not willingly labour.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote23" id="Footnote23"></a><a href="#FNanchor23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Doctor Franklin, it is said, drew the bill for the
  gradual abolition of slavery in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote24" id="Footnote24"></a><a href="#FNanchor24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> It is probable that similar laws have been passed in
  some other states; but I have not been able to procure a note of
  them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote25" id="Footnote25"></a><a href="#FNanchor25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The object of the amendment proposed to be offered
  to the legislature, was to emancipate all slaves born after a
  certain period; and further directing that they should continue
  with their parents to a certain age, then be brought up, at the
  public expence, to tillage, arts, or sciences, according to their
  geniuses, till the females should be eighteen, and the males
  twenty-one years of age, when they should be colonized to such a
  place as the circumstances of the time should render most proper;
  sending them out with arms, implements of household and of the
  handicraft arts, seeds, pairs of the useful domestic animals, &amp;c.
  to declare them a free and independent people, and extend to them
  our alliance and protection, till they shall have acquired
  strength; and to send vessels at the same time to other parts of
  the world for an equal number of white inhabitants; to induce whom
  to migrate hither, proper encouragements should be proposed. Notes
  on Virginia, 251.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote26" id="Footnote26"></a><a href="#FNanchor26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> It will probably be asked, why not retain the blacks
  among us and <i>incorporate them into the state</i>? Deep-rooted
  prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections
  by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new
  provocations; the <i>real distinctions</i> which <i>nature</i> has made; and
  many other circumstances will divide us into parties and produce
  convulsions, which will probably never end but in the
  extermination of one or the other race. To these objections which
  are political may be added others which are physical and moral.
  The first difference which strikes us is that of colour.&mdash;&amp;c. The
  circumstance of superior beauty is thought worthy attention in the
  propagation of our horses, dogs, and other domestic animals; Why
  not in that of man? &amp;c. In general their existence appears to
  participate more of sensation than reflection. Comparing them by
  their faculties of memory, reason and imagination, it appears to
  me that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much
  inferior; that in imagination they are dull, tasteless and
  anamolous. &amp;c. The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in
  the first instance of their mixture with the whites, has been
  observed by every one, and proves that their inferiority is not
  the effect merely of their condition of life. We know that among
  the Romans, about the Augustan age, especially, the condition of
  their slaves was much more deplorable, than that of the blacks on
  the continent of America. Yet among the Romans their slaves were
  often their rarest artists. They excelled too in science, insomuch
  as to be usually employed as tutors to their masters' children.
  Epictetus, Terence, and Phoedrus were slaves. But they were of the
  race of whites. It is not their condition then, but nature, which
  has produced the distinction. The opinion that they are inferior
  in the faculties of reason and imagination, must be hazarded with
  great diffidence. To justify a general conclusion requires many
  observations. &amp;c.&mdash;I advance it therefore as a suspicion only,
  that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made
  distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites
  both in the endowments of body and mind. &amp;c. This unfortunate
  difference of colour, and perhaps of faculty, is a powerful
  obstacle to the emancipation of these people. Among the Romans
  emancipation required but one effort. The slave, when made free,
  might mix with, without staining, the blood of his master. But
  with us a second is necessary, unknown to history.&mdash;See the
  passage at length, Notes on Virginia, page 252 to 265.</p>

<p>"In the present case, it is not only the slave who is beneath his
  master, it is the Negroe who is beneath the white man. No act of
  enfranchisement can efface this unfortunate distinction."
  Chatelleux's Travels in America.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote27" id="Footnote27"></a><a href="#FNanchor27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The celebrated David Hume, in his Essay on National
  Character, advances the same opinion; Doctor Beattie, in his Essay
  on Truth, controverts it with many powerful arguments. Early
  prejudices, had we more satisfactory information than we can
  possibly possess on the subject at present, would render an
  inhabitant of a country where Negroe slavery prevails, an improper
  umpire between them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote28" id="Footnote28"></a><a href="#FNanchor28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> See Spirit of Laws, 12-15.&mdash;&mdash;1. Black Com. 417.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote29" id="Footnote29"></a><a href="#FNanchor29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The immense territory of Louisiana, which extends as
  far south as the lat. 25° and the two Floridas, would probably
  afford a ready asylum for such as might choose to become Spanish
  subjects. How far their political rights might be enlarged in
  these countries, is, however questionable: but the climate is
  undoubtedly more favourable to the African constitution than ours,
  and from this cause, it is not improbable that emigrations from
  these states would in time be very considerable.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote30" id="Footnote30"></a><a href="#FNanchor30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> As it may not be unacceptable to some readers to
  observe the operation of this plan, I shall subjoin the following
  statement:</p>
